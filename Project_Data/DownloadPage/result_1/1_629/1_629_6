Since its creation in 2000, the Résidence has welcomed more than one hundred and seventy filmmakers from more than fifty different countries. It makes available to them a place of residence in the heart of Paris, a personalised programme accompanying the writing of their scripts, and a collective programme of forums with film industry professionals. Nearly fifty filmmakers emerging from the great halls of this "Villa Médicis" of cinema have seen their films selected by international festivals and distributed in theatres. The residents equally benefit from: - a 800-euro grant per month; - free access to a large number Paris cinemas; - French lessons (optional); - the possibility of attending festivals during their stay. The selection of the residents by a jury, presided by a director or a motion-picture celebrity, is based on the quality of their already made shorts - or first feature film, as well as on the interest of the feature film project in the course of being written, and on the candidates' motivation. © Festival de Cannes - All rights reserved Credits| Contact| Legal mentions| Sitemap| FAQ Politique de cookies
