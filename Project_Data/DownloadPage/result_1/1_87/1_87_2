Accredited Online Christian Colleges: How to Choose a School Learn about important considerations when selecting an online accredited Christian school. Keep reading to get an overview of the program options, personal faith factors, and common levels offered for fields of study. View 10 Popular Schools Â» Show me popular schools How to Select an Online Accredited Christian School Students considering online accredited Christian schools must make their decision based on several key factors. There are almost as many choices in accredited degree programs from online Christian colleges as there are from traditional on-campus programs. Finding the right college often isn't so much a matter of finding the best or most reputable Christian college as it is finding an institution and degree program that are the best fit for an individual student's interests and beliefs. Area of Study The first step for prospective students is to determine what sort of degree best fits with their career plans, and to decide what kind of institution best fits their personal temperament. Because Christian colleges are often much smaller than public universities, many of them have a very limited number of choices in degree programs and focuses. Some are seminaries that offer courses of study specifically in the Bible. Others offer traditional degree programs. The program a student chooses often limits their choices in what college they attend. Personal Compatibility Some Christian colleges are relatively strict and require their students to promise that they will not drink alcohol or participate in activities such as dancing while in college. Others are more liberal in their requirements, requiring only that they behave in a responsible manner while in college. Religious Beliefs Some colleges, though they are Christian colleges, invite students of all faiths to attend. Others require students to agree with a set of beliefs and doctrines in order to attend. Which university a student attends is often purely a matter of personal preference and of the institutional style they are comfortable with. Available Programs and Formats Degree Availability and Types Degrees from Christian colleges are often as varied as those from public universities, though often an online Christian college will not offer as wide a range of degree options as public colleges, and comparatively few Christian colleges offer associate's degrees via distance learning. Degrees are offered at the bachelor's, master's and doctoral levels.
