Small Steps to Living Healthy Finding success in healthy weight isn’t always easy, but it helps to take small steps. Small Steps to Living Healthy is an email-based program that allows Floridians to sign up for weekly tips and tricks delivered directly to their inbox. What is Healthiest Weight Florida? The number one public health threat to Florida's future is unhealthy weight. Currently, only 36 percent of Floridians are at healthy weight. On our current trend, by 2030, almost 60 percent will be obese. Additionally, six out of ten children born today will be obese by the time they graduate high school. Over the next 20 years in Florida, obesity is expected to contribute to millions of cases of preventable chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer, costing an estimated $34 billion. To address this important public health issue, the Department of Health launched the Healthiest Weight Florida initiative in January 2013. Healthiest Weight Florida is a public-private collaboration bringing together state agencies, not for profit organizations, businesses, and entire communities to help Florida’s children and adults make consistent, informed choices about healthy eating and active living. The initiative works closely with partners to leverage existing resources to maximize reach and impact. These partners include the business community, hospitals, non-governmental organizations, non-profit agencies, other federal, state, or local government agencies, and volunteer coalitions. The overall goal is to bend the weight curve by 5% by 2017. Healthiest Weight Florida is a public-private collaboration bringing together state agencies, not for profit organizations, businesses, and entire communities to help Florida's children and adults make choices about healthy eating and active living.
