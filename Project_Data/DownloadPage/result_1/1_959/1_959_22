Ashliman A disturbing, but ultimately important, explanation of how “Changeling” legends (that is, legends of human children kidnapped by, and substituted with, demons or elves) were actually stories supporting abusive “cures” of disabled children -- particularly of those with autism and Down’s Syndrome -- which most often killed them. tumblunni: aegipanomnicorn:  Don’t expect to have much of an appetite after reading this. But  as most of these stories were collected and published in the 19th century, and the stories themselves are centuries older than that, I figure this information is the best vaccine* against the meme, spread by Autism $peaks, that autism is some sort of modern plague. And it’s in that light that I share this.  Spread the word. *Yes, I chose that metaphor on purpose Oh man i always related a lot to changeling stories even before i knew i was autistic, i never realized these might be their origins… What’s really chilling is the point he makes about how these are still classified as “legends” – not “wonder tales” – meaning that people take them as very old fact-based stories. In other words: People actually believed that autistic kids are demon children, or aliens, or fairies – or some other form of threatening, scary, inhuman beings, so it’s perfectly okay to torture or kill them to keep society safe. tumblunni Source: aegipanomnicorn modern ableism is superstitious folklore history autism speaks is a hate group 67 notes Mar 29th, 2016 Open in app Facebook Tweet Reddit Mail Embed Permalink noddytheornithopod calderonbeta: Nothing about us without us.  Image description: [pale purple and yellow background with dark text] This April, don’t support an organization that harms autistic people.
