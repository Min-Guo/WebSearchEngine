Without limiting the foregoing, in connection with client engagements involving specific services, McKinsey’s United States entities have certified to the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework with respect to certain personal information about its clients’ personnel located in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. McKinsey is aware that the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks may, in light of a 2015 ruling by the European Court of Justice, no longer constitute an adequate basis for the transfer of personal information to the United States. Nevertheless, McKinsey also believes that the Safe Harbor principles continue to represent important commitments for protecting the privacy and security of personal information, and McKinsey will continue to abide by these principles in the course of the specific services covered by its Safe Harbor certification, as well as with any other commitments made to its clients.
