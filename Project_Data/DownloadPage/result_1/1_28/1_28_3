(b) When a tie must be broken to determine a division winner, the results of the tie-break shall be used to determine only the division winner, and not for any other purpose. (2) If a tie involves more than two teams, the tie-break criteria in subparagraph b. shall be applied in the order set forth therein until the first to occur of the following: (a) Each of the tied teams has a different winning percentage or point differential under the applicable tie-break criterion (a "complete" breaking of the tie). In this circumstance, the team with the best winning percentage or point differential under the criterion will be awarded the best playoff position, the team with the next-best winning percentage or point differential will be awarded the next-best playoff position, and so on, and no further application of the tie-break criteria will be required. --OR-- (b) One or more (but not all) of the tied teams has a different winning�percentage or point differential under the applicable tie-break criterion (a "partial" breaking of the tie). In this circumstance: (x) any team(s) that performed better under the applicable criterion than any other team(s) will be awarded a higher playoff position than such other team(s); and (y) teams that had equivalent performance under the applicable criterion will remain tied, and such remaining tie(s) will be broken by applying, from the beginning, the criteria in subparagraph a.(1)-(6) above (for any remaining tie involving only two teams) or subparagraph b.(1)-(5) above (for any remaining tie involving more than two teams) and the guidelines set forth in this subparagraph c. (3) If application of the criteria in subparagraph a. or b. does not result in the breaking of a tie, the playoff positions of the tied teams will be determined by a random drawing. back to top About About the NBA Contact Us Career Opportunities Closed Captioning Advertise on NBA.com Important Dates FAQs NBA WNBA NBA D-League Ene-be-a NBA Communications NBATickets.com NBPA USA Basketball Youth NYC Store Events 2016 Hall of Fame 2016 NBA Draft 2016 NBA Playoffs 2016 NBA All-Star 2015 Summer League NBA 101 NBA Official History Officials & Rulebook Video Rulebook NBA Guide NBA Register NBA Initiatives NBA Cares Jr. NBA NBA Green NBA FIT Hoops for Troops All-Star Supplier Diversity & Inclusion NBA Account Member Center NBA LEAGUE PASS Fantasy Games HOOP Magazine Copyright © 2016 NBA Media Ventures, LLC.
