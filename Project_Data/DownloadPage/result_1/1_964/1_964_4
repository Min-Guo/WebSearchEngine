SupportApplication License Agreement What's New in Version 3.7.1 Bug Fixes Screenshots iPhone iPad Customer Reviews Gold Standard for eCommerce App       by zobc First, Zappos is just an awesome shopping experience. It's as if they know, "Oh, you were thinking about buying some shoes." Then they show up at your door the next day! Shipping is crazy fast. And I have learned that certain brands' sizes fit me consistently. So it really is faster than going shopping for shoes, which can take a couple of days over several stores. And, they make returns so easy, you can order four or five pairs to try on when you're not sure about fit, then send back the ones you don't want to keep. It's very little overhead. And their mobile app is the gold standard from a user experience. It's easy to filter and view inventory. They do a brilliant job maximizing the real estate for mobile devices - not too much, not too little. And checking out is super fast and easy. The app is clean, highly effective, and fun to use. There are tiny little touches in the way the app transitions and presents messages that just make me smile. Everything about the Zappos model works for me! Love 'em! Best shopping experience E.V.E.R.       by IHateNicknames!!!!!!! I love shopping at Zappos. I always know I'm getting the best price, my package is always at my door the next day, and if I'm not satisfied - returning or exchanging couldn't be easier; even if it's a year later. The customer support staff is wonderful. I called once and could hear what sounded like a party in the background of my super nice customer service rep. I asked him if everyone was always that happy and he said that the office was actually lightly staffed at that time. I said it sounded like a wonderful place to work. He agreed it was. It's nice to be able to shop with a company that takes such pride in their work and makes every effort to show they care. I know it sounds strange, but aside from the free shipping, that's what keeps me coming back to the site. Zappos fan for life!       by Ladybuggreeneyes I've shopped Zappos for years now and never once have had a bad experience! I've got the most cantankerous feet following two foot surgeries and am on my feet a lot. Without Zappos, I'm left wasting a lot of time endlessly searching and driving around looking for supportive shoes for any occasion. I'm able to order several styles at once and return what doesn't work easily. I rely on other reviews to help find a great fit. Biggest problem is when I love them all and don't want to return any! I am a sales rack girl but gladly pay a little more for quality Zappos products delivered quickly. What clothing I've ordered has always been as described and just as great. Keep up the great selection and wonderful service!
