WE ORIGINALLY WANTED TO PURCHASE 6 BUT WE HAD EXPLAINED TO THE CASHIER THAT DUE TO ME NOT RECEIVING MY CHECK UNTIL TODAY MY WIFE WOULD NOT HAVE THE CASH UNTIL TODAY AND I ASKED IF WE WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE OTHER PAIRS WE NEEDED FOR OUR FAMILY, HAPPILY AND VERY POLITELY HE SAID AS LONG AS WE HAD OUR RECEIPT THERE WOULD BE NO ISSUE. WE THANKED HIM AND WENT ON ABOUT OUR DAY. TODAY WE RETURNED TO THE SAME STORE IN SOUTHGATE WITH THE RECEIPT IN HAND FROM THE 19TH OF DECEMBER. THE YOUNG LADY CASHIER SAID HER BOSS HAD TO APPROVE THE ADJUSTMENT AS PER EXPECTED WE HAD NO ISSUES WITH THIS. SHE WALKED TO THE OLDER LADY AND EXPLAINED TO HER AND SHOWED HER OUR RECEIPT. SHE NEVER EVEN GLANCED AT IT BEFORE SAYING NO!!!! DO NOT APPROVE THE ADJUSTMENT. MY WIFE AND I ASKED WHY THE OLDER LADY SAID SHE SAID NO. I ASK TO SPEAK WITH THE STORE MANAGER WHO HAPPENED TO BE WORKING ONE OF THE REGISTERS TO HELP WITH THE LINE. ONCE ASKED OVER I THEN EXPLAINED EVERYTHING ABOVE AND WAS TOLD STRAIGHT FORWARD PRICES CHANGE AND THAT HE WOULD NOT HONOR THE NEW ADJUSTMENT THEN REMOVED MY ITEMS FROM THE COUNTER PLACED THEM IN A CART BEHIND HIM AND TOLD US HE COULD NO LONGER HELP US HE HAD OTHER PAYING CUSTOMERS TO TAKE CARE OF AND SORT OF MOVED ME OUT OF THE WAY (WE WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE NOT COMPLAINERS AND HAVE BEEN REGULAR CUSTOMERS AT THAT BEST BUY LOCATION FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS). DUE TO MY WIFE BEING Â UNCONFRONTATIONAL I DECIDED TO CALL CORPORATE AFTER BEING TRANSFERRED 4 TIMES AND BEING ON HOLD FOR 45 MINUTES I WAS SOMEHOW TRANSFERRED TO THE EXACT SAME STORE MANAGER (DENNIS PLEARS AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT HE TOLD ME IT WAS) AT THE STORE AS TO WHICH Â I WAS CALLING TO FILE A COMPLAINT ON. ONCE ON THE PHONE NOT ONLY WAS HE RUDE HE INSULTED ME AS WELL AS TOLD ME THAT HE ALREADY DENIED MY ADJUSTMENT ONCE AND I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP. AND IF I HAD ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY I SHOULD CALL CORPORATE AND HUNG UP. ONCE AGAIN i CALLED CORPORATE AGAIN SPOKE WITH 3 PEOPLE IN A MATTER OF 45 MINUTES. IN THE APPROX. 2 HOURS I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED TO 8 PEOPLE 4 DEPARTMENTS ONE STORE AND ONE STORE MANAGER I WAS CALLING TO FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT. IN THE END THE LADY ON THE PHONE TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT DO ANYTHING FOR US AND SHE WOULD FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE MANAGER. AND THAT WAS THAT. IN READING BACK THE COMPLAINT SHE SAID THAT THE CUSTOMER CALLED IN CRYING ABOUT NOT GET A PRICE ADJUSTED AND WAS UNHAPPY. Â Â ï»¿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...
