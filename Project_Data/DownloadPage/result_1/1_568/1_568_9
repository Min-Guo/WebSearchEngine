This free virtual summer camp takes place Aug. 1–7, 2015, through the department's Facebook and Twitter accounts. "Florida's children need to stay physically and mentally active during this summer school break," said State Surgeon General and Secretary of Health Dr. John Armstrong. "I ask parents to encourage their children to participate in this online summer camp that helps build healthy habits for a lifetime." The department has partnered with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection and the Florida Department of Children and Families to create interactive content to encourage healthy habits for Florida's young people. To search for posts on Facebook and Twitter, use the hashtag #FLHealthCamp. The camp features a variety of health topics and encourages young Floridians to choose healthy habits, engage in their communities and achieve their healthiest weights. Individuals taking part in the department's virtual online summer camp will learn how to: Select events that will encourage physical activity; Choose healthy and delicious meals and snacks; Protect against mosquitos and other disease carriers; Engage in their community; Practice first aid, sun safety, water safety and heat safety; Plan for emergencies; Explore the great Florida outdoors; and Consider a public health career and learn more about the Disease Detective Camp sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Summer is a great time to engage young minds and this campaign does just that," said Florida Department of Children and Families Secretary Mike Carroll. "We are pleased to partner with DOH and DEP to help share positive initiatives to help keep more Florida families safe while children are out of school." Children participating in the camp are encouraged to keep a daily log of what they learn through the interactive posts, as well as invite their friends to join in the fun with a Florida Health Camp letter. Upon finishing all the activities at the end of the week, there is a Certificate of Participation that the camper can download and print for their log book. The Florida Health Online Summer Camp is geared toward elementary to middle-school-aged children. "DEP is proud to offer its Junior Ranger program as part of the ‘Florida Health Online Summer Camp,'" says DEP Secretary Jon Steverson. "Our Junior Ranger program encourages young people to discover the natural and cultural resources of our state parks and trails system. Florida State Parks offer recreational opportunities that can be enjoyed for a lifetime and encourage a healthy lifestyle."
