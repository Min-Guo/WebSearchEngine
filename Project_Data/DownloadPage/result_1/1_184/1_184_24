Data Surveys Instruments Collaboration Results Education Future Contact Search for: Search The Sloan Digital Sky Survey: Mapping the Universe The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. Learn and explore all phases and surveys—past, present, and future—of the SDSS.

It and Data Releases 1-7 are fully intact and can now be found on the “SDSS Classic” website. We continue to maintain the SDSS3.org website. Data Releases 8-10 can be found there. SDSS Classic SDSS-III Connect With Us The SDSS began regular survey operations in 2000, after a decade of design and construction.  It has progressed through several phases, SDSS-I (2000-2005), SDSS-II (2005-2008), SDSS-III (2008-2014), and SDSS-IV (2014-).  Each of these phases has involved multiple surveys with interlocking science goals.  The three surveys that comprise SDSS-IV are eBOSS, APOGEE-2, and MaNGA, described at the links below.  You can find more about the surveys of SDSS I-III by following the Prior Surveys link. APOGEE-2 Exploring the Milky Way from both hemispheres Explore eBOSS Surveying galaxies and quasars to measure the Universe Explore MaNGA Mapping the inner workings of thousands of nearby galaxies Explore Prior Surveys Discovering the Universe at all scales Explore Acknowledgments Funding for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV has been provided by the Alfred P.
