Learn about our current programs: The UCAR Center for Science Education (SciEd) offers wheels-to-the-ground education and outreach programs that engage people in the wonder and relevance of science. The GLOBE Program is implemented through a worldwide network of over 24,000 primary and secondary schools, as well as many universities around the world. Through the use of the Internet, these schools monitor environmental changes both locally and worldwide, and document their findings in scientific research reports. Digital Learning Sciences (DLS) develops systems and services that enable science and education organizations to organize, manage, and enrich online resources to improve learning outcomes and learner engagement. SOARS, part of SciEd, is an undergraduate-to-graduate program built around a summer research internship that is mentored by top scientists and a supportive learning community. ULW, which is a part of SciEd, is a summer workshop in Boulder, CO with the purpose of informing students about exciting research and career opportunities in the atmospheric and related sciences. UCAR Connect is a free and open collection of audience-focused and topic-driven digital resources that are accessible across all platforms and devices. It takes a novel playlist approach that is active, emergent, and responsive to the needs of UCAR’s varied audiences. COMET/MetEd provides training and certification programs for geoscience professionals through virtual and in-person professional development programs.
