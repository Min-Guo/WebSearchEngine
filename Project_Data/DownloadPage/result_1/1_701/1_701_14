Announcements Due to an error in the collection of utility (piped) gas service prices in Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint, MI, the following series were corrected for January through February 2016. We corrected utility (piped) gas and energy services, and the average retail price per therm of utility gas. For the C-CPI-U, we corrected housing, fuels and utilities, services, and energy. Change in formula for calculation of index for prescription drugs Effective with release of data for January 2016, an arithmetic mean (Laspeyres) formula will replace the geometric mean formula in the calculation of the elementary indexes in the CPI-U, CPI-W, and C-CPI-U for prescription drugs. The Laspeyres formula at the elementary index level is more appropriate for use in categories in which substitution by the consumer in response to price change is difficult or unrealistic. A description of the 1999 adoption of the geometric mean formula for many elementary indexes is available at http://www.bls.gov/mlr/1998/10/art1full.pdf.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) undertook a joint project to detail and quantify the differences between the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Chain-type Price Index. A paper summarizing these differences can be found on the BEA website at http://www.bea.gov/papers/pdf/cpi_pce.pdf. The latest reconciliation tables can be found at http://www.bea.gov/national/consumer_spending.htm. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces regional price parities (RPPs). RPPs measure the differences in the price levels of goods and services across states and metropolitan areas for a given year. RPPs are expressed as a percentage of the overall national price level for each year, which is equal to 100.0. These data, which are the products of BEA and not BLS, can be found at https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/rpp/rpp_newsrelease.htm.

How is the CPI used? Whose buying habits does the CPI reflect? Is the CPI a cost-of-living index? Does the CPI measure my experience with price changes? How is the CPI market basket determined? What goods and services does the CPI cover? How are CPI prices collected and reviewed? How is the CPI calculated? How are taxes treated in the CPI? All CPI FAQs » CPI Special Notices Notices Revised Seasonal Indexes UPDATED Each year with the release of the January CPI, seasonal adjustment factors are recalculated to reflect price movements from the just-completed calendar year. This routine annual recalculation may result in revisions to seasonally adjusted indexes for the previous 5 years. BLS made available recalculated seasonally adjusted indexes, as well as recalculated seasonal adjustment factors, for the period January 2011 through December 2015, on Wednesday, February 17, 2016. For information on seasonal adjustment in the CPI, including revised indexes, seasonal factors, methodology, and actions taken in 2015, see our page on seasonal adjustment. Social Security COLA Soon after the publication of September CPI data each October, the Social Security Administration (SSA) announces the annual change in its benefit payments for the coming year for Social Security's Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs. Specific information on how the Social Security Administration uses the CPI to determine cost-of-living adjustments can be found at http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/colasummary.html. CPI Published Numbers Effective with the release in February 2007 of the January 2007 Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) began to publish its consumer price indexes rounded to three decimal places. Percent changes will be calculated from the three decimal place indexes. Those percent changes will continue to be published to one decimal place.
