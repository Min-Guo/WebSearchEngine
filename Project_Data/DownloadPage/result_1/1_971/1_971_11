For a complete list of tutorials, see the Tutorials page. Solutions provide cross-platform scenarios and architectures that show you how you can use Cloud Platform components together to solve business problems. For a complete list of solutions, see the Solutions page. Use the left-hand navigation or the following sections to access the various sets of documentation that cover Cloud Platform features in detail. Computing and hosting Storage Big data Management Services Developer tools Computing and hosting App Engine App Engine is Google's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Develop your application easily using built-in services that make you more productive. Deploy to a fully-managed platform and let Google carry the pager. Just download the SDK and start building immediately for free with no credit card required. Overview Get Started Tutorials: Java, PHP, Python, Go Documentation Compute Engine Compute Engine is Google's Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Run large-scale workloads on virtual machines hosted on Google's infrastructure. Choose a VM that fits your needs and gain the performance and consistency of Google’s worldwide fiber network. With per-minute billing, you pay only for what you use. Overview Get Started Tutorial Documentation Container Engine Google Container Engine is a powerful cluster manager and orchestration system for running your Docker containers. Container Engine schedules your containers into the cluster and manages them automatically based on requirements you define (such as CPU and memory). It's built on the open source Kubernetes system, giving you the flexibility to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure. Overview Tutorial Documentation Storage Cloud SQL Store and manage data using a relational MySQL database. Google handles replication, patch management and database management to ensure availability and performance, and you can even have your instance automatically co-locate with your deployed applications. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud Storage Use a durable and highly available object storage service. With global edge-caching, your users have fast access to your app’s data from any location. Google manages versioning, guarantees a strong SLA and provides a simple API that allows you to manage your data programmatically. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud Datastore Cloud Datastore provides a managed, NoSQL, schemaless database for storing non-relational data. Cloud Datastore automatically scales as you need it and supports transactions as well as robust, SQL-like queries. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud Bigtable Cloud Bigtable offers a fast, fully managed, massively scalable NoSQL database service that's ideal for web, mobile, and Internet of Things applications that require terabytes to petabytes of data. Cloud Bigtable's underlying technology has been battle-tested at Google for more than 10 years—it's the storage system that drives major applications such as Google Analytics and Gmail. Overview Tutorial Documentation For more information about choosing the right storage solution for your application, see Storing Your Data. Big data BigQuery Analyze Big Data in the cloud with BigQuery. Run fast, SQL-like queries against multi-terabyte datasets in seconds. Scalable and easy to use, BigQuery gives you real-time insights about your data. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud Dataflow A simple, flexible, and powerful system you can use to perform data processing tasks of any size. Dataflow excels at high volume computation, where the steps in your job need to process an amount of data that exceeds the memory capacity of a cost-effective cluster. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud Dataproc Quickly create managed clusters of any size, run Hadoop MapReduce, Spark, Pig, or Hive jobs on them, then turn your clusters off when you are done. Pay only for the resources that you need, when you need them. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud Datalab Interactively explore, analyze, and visualize data on Google Cloud Platform, then share and publish your results. Cloud Datalab runs on Google App Engine and orchestrates multiple services automatically, letting you stay focused on your data. Overview Tutorial Documentation Management Deployment Manager Easily declare, deploy, and maintain complex applications using a simple templating mechanism, then deploy it with a single command. Deployment Manager then provisions, scales, and monitors your solution. Overview Tutorial Documentation Services Cloud Endpoints Create RESTful services from your code and make them accessible to iOS, Android and Javascript clients. Automatically generate client libraries to make wiring up the frontend easy. Overview Tutorials: Python, Java Documentation Cloud Pub/Sub Google Cloud Pub/Sub is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can send messages to a "topic" and other applications can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. Overview Tutorial Documentation Cloud DNS A highly available and scalable DNS service designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost effective way to route end users to Internet applications and services. Overview Tutorial Documentation Stackdriver Monitoring The Google Monitoring API allows you to read monitoring data such as response times, uptime, disk usage, MySQL queries, and more for your Google Cloud Platform projects.
