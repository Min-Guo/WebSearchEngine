Skip to main content   Hang Time Podcast (Episode 227) Featuring Tyronn Lue and Fred McLeod February 17, 2016  ·  3:34 PM ET HANG TIME HEADQUARTERS — We’re caught in that strange stretch of the NBA calendar right now, days removed from a stellar All-Star Weekend in Toronto and hours away from the wildly unpredictable trade deadline (Thursday at 3 p.m. ET) that sets the tone for the stretch run of every season. Can the Golden State Warriors finish the deal and chase and even break the Chicago Bulls’ hallowed, NBA-record 72-win season? Can the San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder or anyone else in the Western Conference catch up to the Warriors? And is anyone willing to gamble whatever it takes to join the elite out west? In the Eastern Conference, all eyes are on Cleveland, where Tyronn Lue and LeBron James have to bring everyone (Kyrie Irving, Kevin Love and everyone else) together in their quest to make a return trip to The Finals where they can get another shot at the Warriors and finishing what they started last year That’s why we’re kicking off the stretch run of the season for The Hang Time Podcast with a double-dose of Cavs, talking to both Lue (during All-Star Weekend) and the team’s executive producer of multi-media and play-by-play announcer Fred McLeod. We dig deep in an effort to find out exactly what to expect from the Cavaliers the rest of the way, while also wrapping up our All-Star thoughts (big ups to young skywalkers Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon for the best Verizon Slam Dunk showcase in years) and looking ahead to what we think might go down at the trade deadline. Check it all out on Episode 227 of The Hang Time Podcast featuring Tyronn Lue and Fred McLeod of the Cleveland Cavaliers. LISTEN HERE: http://www.nba.com/.element/mp3/2.0/sect/podcastmp3/NBA/podcast/20160217_hangtime_podcast.mp3 As always, we welcome your feedback. You can follow the entire crew, including the Hang Time Podcast, co-hosts Sekou Smith of NBA.com, Lang Whitaker of NBA.com’s All-Ball Blog and renaissance man Rick Fox of NBA TV, as well as our new super producer Gregg (just like Popovich) Waigand. – To download the podcast, click here.

What a rocket scientist, cav’s beat GSW. I don’t know if you heard but GSW had beaten da cav’s 7 out of the last 8 times they’ve played. So what has changed. Da cav’s will have difficulty getting out of the pathetic east. If they do, you know who’ll be waiting. another bad ending for da king. Ashok Mudrakola says: February 18, 2016 at 12:12 am The current team of Cavaliers is good enough to beat Warriors. Get the mind set of each player on the post season. Plan the offense strategies, practice them and execute them. Let Lebron play only 32 minutes per game. | Recent Posts Jersey ads, N.C. gender law among topics at Board of Governors meeting Numbers preview: Warriors-Rockets Numbers preview: Raptors-Pacers Reports: Wizards fire Wittman Jerry Colangelo on Hinkie, process: ‘At some point you’ve got to win’ Hang Time Podcast (Episode 234) Kobe’s Last Stand Report: Kings to dismiss George Karl Blogtable: Outlook on 76ers’ future?
