More than 100,000 FIU alumni live and work in South Florida. Our colleges and schools　offer more than 200 bachelors, masters and doctoral programs in fields such as engineering, the sciences, international relations and law. As one of South Florida’s anchor institutions, FIU has been locally and globally engaged for more than four decades finding solutions to the most challenging problems of our time. FIU emphasizes research as a major component of its mission. The opening of the Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine has enhanced the university’s ability to create lasting change through its research initiatives. Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry includes 33 faculty members and has dynamic and growing Ph.D. and Masters Programs in Chemistry, Forensic Sciences and Biochemistry with over 100 graduate students, and an annual research budget of $4 million. Although a relatively young program, a great deal of success has been achieved both in attracting external research funding and quality graduate students and faculty to the department. The Department awards degrees in all of the traditional subspecialties of chemistry: analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and biochemistry. The research emphasis is on biomedical, environmental and forensic aspects of chemistry. A multi-disciplinary approach to addressing problems in these areas is encouraged. Thank you for considering our department in your pursuit of graduate education. Feel free to peruse our website to see if the research experience we offer fits your needs.
