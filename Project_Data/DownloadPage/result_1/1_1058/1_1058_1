It has been identified in several countries in Central and South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean since 2015. Outbreaks have previously been reported in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands. Local transmission has been reported in Puerto Rico, but not elsewhere in the United States. Cases of Zika fever have been reported in travelers returning to the United States. Drain and Cover 2016 1:00 Keep Vaccine Between You and Disease 0:29 ACCREDITATION PLAQUE UNVEILED During the Public Health Award Ceremony, DOH-Orange announced the Florida Department of Health as the first integrated department of health in the nation to achieve national accreditation through the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) and unveiled the accreditation plaque received. Public health departments play a critical role in protecting and improving the health of people and communities. The seal of accreditation signifies that the Florida Department of Health processes have been rigorously examined and meet or exceed national standards that promote continuous quality improvement for public health. ��It is an honor to join the state office and all other county health departments in meeting and/or exceeding the national standards for public health performance and together be an integrated accredited health department,” said Dr. Kevin Sherin, director of the Florida Department of Health in Orange County. “The road to accreditation was one that included the contribution of everyone in our DOH-Orange family and a number of key community partners who joined the process for a PHAB site visit to share examples of our collaboration including hospitals, elected officials, media, and community based organizations.” Healthy Eating and Healthy Weight Upcoming Events ALFRED L.
