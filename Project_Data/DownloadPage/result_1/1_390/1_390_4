Naeem khanShared publicly  -  2014-09-11   Pakistan originally shared:   Today is the death anniversary of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The man who spent his whole life to get a separate homeland for us. And what we have done for the beautiful country he gave to us? Let's question our own selves today. We always blame and criticize Government as well as others for not doing anything for the betterment of Pakistan but still what we have done for the advancement of society we live in? Let's Stop Talking and Start Doing. Today I am going to make a pledge that:- “Till the next 11th September, 2015, I will help 30 Pakistani’s (comprising of 10 groups) in launching online business without any remuneration or share. I will provide following services to them free of cost:- a) Website Development (WordPress) b) Social Media Promotion (Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Tumblr) c) Trainings (Web Development, Online Marketing, Entrepreneurship) d) Completion of Legal requirements I will share the detailed plan of action as well as selection criteria during upcoming week on this page.” So what is your pledge? What you are going to do for the betterment of Pakistan or the society you live in? Don’t be shy. I too was always afraid of reaching out and discussing my ideas with others. Pakistan is our homeland and it’s our shared responsibility to fix all the problems faced by Pakistan today. Let’s join our hands to bring the positive change in the society. Start small but make a start. Together we can make anything possible. Share your pledge in a reply to this post and all those who don’t have any idea are encouraged to join those who are willing to do something. I will try my best to support you in every possible way I can. Feel free to ask any question you have. You can educate a child, teach someone any skill, launch an online awareness campaign, volunteer for a cause etc. There are endless possibilities out there if you are willing to do something. If you don’t have any pledge to make but still want to help us than share this post with your friends and family.
