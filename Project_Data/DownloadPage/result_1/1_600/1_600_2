Thank you Great app       by Memo Corea I have really enjoyed using this app. Love how I've been able to customize the type of information I get. Being a visual person, the look-and-feel and functionality are fantastic! Still no save to Pocket       by Not SAIC user I rely on Pocket to catch up on off-line reading during available times. A direct save to pocket (and likely some similar reader apps) would give the app 5 stars. Meanwhile, as a workaround pocket users can email articles to their account using the add@getpocket address.
