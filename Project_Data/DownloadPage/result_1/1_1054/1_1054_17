Verdell Jones III led the way with 27 points for the Warriors, going 11-for-20 from the field and 3-for-5 from beyond the arc. Xavier Henry contributed with 17 points and six rebounds off the bench, while Aaron Craft had 15 points and eight assists. Darington Hobson had a double-double with 10 points and 10 rebounds. Idaho was led by Corey Hawkins, who scored a game-high 37 points on 13-for-23 shooting. Phil Pressey added 20 points and nine assists, while Treveon Graham and Jeremy Williams each chipped in with 14 points. Santa Cruz got out to an 11-7 lead with 7:19 left in the first quarter after a layup off a steal from Jones, who scored seven of his points in the first five minutes of the game. Idaho would go on an 11-0 run take to take a 26-23 advantage at the close of the first quarter. Idaho bumped its lead up to as many as 13 points in the second quarter, but Henry helped keep the game close for Santa Cruz with a bevy of step-back jumpers. A mini 4-0 spurt to end the second quarter would put the Warriors within nine points by halftime. Idaho went on a 10-1 run to take a 65-49 lead midway through the third period. From there, Santa Cruz outscored Idaho 21-10 the rest of the third to close out the quarter trailing by just five. Buoyed by a 17-0 run spanning the third and fourth quarters, Santa Cruz went ahead 79-75 on a Terrence Drisdom dunk at the 9:46 mark of the fourth. The Warriors and Stampede exchanged the lead twice more during the period, with Santa Cruz pulling ahead 91-85 after Jones completed a 3-point play with 4:16 remaining. Idaho tied it back up at 94-94 with a Graham layup with 24.7 seconds left and had a chance to end the game in regulation, but Hawkins narrowly missed a half-court buzzer-beater. In overtime, Santa Cruz and Idaho traded three-pointers for the first two minutes of the extra frame, with Idaho taking a 103-100 lead after a Pressey triple with 1:06 remaining. Aaron Craft’s layup cut it to 106-104 with 10 seconds left, but Pressey hit two free throws to make sure Santa Cruz did not get a game-tying look. Santa Cruz closes out the 2015-16 season Saturday night in Boise on the back end of the weekend series. Tip is slated for 6 p.m. PST and can be watched online by visiting santacruzbasketball.com at 6pm.
