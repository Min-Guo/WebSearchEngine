Swift detectors are found to be more sensitive to long-soft bursts than pre-Swift missions. This may largely bias the distribution of durations and thus classification of gamma-ray bursts. Aims. We systematically investigate the duration distribution of gamma-ray bursts in the Swift era vs. that of pre-Swift bursts. Methods. For the purpose of this study, statistical methods such as the K-S test and linear/non-linear fitting analysis have been used to examine the duration properties of Swift bursts in both observer and source frames. Results. For 95 GRBs with known redshift, we show that two log-normal distributions of duration are clearly divided at  s. The intrinsic durations also show a bimodal distribution but shift systematically toward the smaller value and the distribution exhibits a narrower width than the observed one. Swift long bursts exhibit a wider duration dynamic range in both observer and source frames in comparison to pre-Swift long bursts. Conclusions. We find that Swift bursts and pre-Swift ones can share the same criterion of classification in terms of duration at 2 s, although both monitors have large differences with respect to sensitivity of a given energy band.

An OpenURL link contains article metadata and directs it to the OpenURL server of your choice. The OpenURL server can provide access to the resource and also offer complementary services (specific search engine, export of references...). The OpenURL link can be generated by different means. If your librarian has set up your subscription with an OpenURL resolver, OpenURL links appear automatically on the abstract pages. You can define your own OpenURL resolver with your EDPS Account. In this case your choice will be given priority over that of your library. You can use an add-on for your browser (Firefox or I.E.) to display OpenURL links on a page (see http://www.openly.com/openurlref/). You should disable this module if you wish to use the OpenURL server that you or your library have defined. Editor-in-Chief: T. Forveille Letters Editor-in-Chief: J. Alves Managing Editor: N.
