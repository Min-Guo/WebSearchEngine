Created by Froide on Jul 29, 2015 [Image source: Windows 10 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]   CNN Money says, "Windows 10 is seriously great - Jul. 28, 2015 ". I'll hold off for a bit, because I need to first back up everything and download important drivers, lest Windows 10 and my devices not play well together.   I am curious about this, though:   Has anyone yet installed Windows 10 on their computer or laptop, and afterward tried using NOOK for PC or NOOKStudy?   (FYI, this MobileRead Forums thread might also interest you:  Windows 10 - free upgrade to those with PC using Windows 7 or 8.)
