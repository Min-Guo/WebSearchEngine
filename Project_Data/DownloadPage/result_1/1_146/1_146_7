WHITE SEA)" A few months ago, we had the incredible honor of working with Universal Audio and the legendary Mick Guzauski on this insanely fun project. For those that don’t know, UA is pretty much my favorite company for all things recording-related. I say this without exaggeration - every single piece of music that I’ve made over the last several years has been touched by UA in some way or other. And as for Mick, well… just take a look at his resume.  The gyst of the project was to come to UA’s headquarters in Santa Cruz, CA and write and record a new piece of music in their amazing Studio 610, all engineered and mixed by Mick, using only UA’s interface and plugins. We felt like kids in a candy store the whole week, getting to see how and where the magic is made at UA, and getting to know some of the many wonderful faces behind some of my absolute favorite gear.
