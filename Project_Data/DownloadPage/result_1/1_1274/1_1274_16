This lesson will describe the rules associated with dividing terms that contain exponents. So, What Is an Exponent Anyway? An exponent is a number written as a superscript to another number. It looks like this: The exponent of a number tells you how many times to multiply that number to itself. So, in the earlier example, 2^3 means 2*2*2, which is equal to 8. Using the carat or ^ symbol is another way to write an exponent that can be easier when typing. Exponents make large multiplication problems easier to write. So, 7*7*7*7*7 = 7^5, because the equation is asking you to multiply 7 to itself 5 times. Division of Exponents Means Subtraction There are certain laws that govern working with exponents. The rule dealing with dividing expressions containing exponents is what this lesson is all about. When you have two exponential expressions that have the same base, you can easily divide one from another. All you have to do in this instance is subtract the exponent of the denominator (the bottom number of a fraction) from the exponent of the numerator (the top number of a fraction). Here's an example: (5^7)/(5^2) To simplify this expression, just subtract the exponents 7 - 2 = 5 So the answer is 5^5 Let's look at how this works. If we write out the multiplication of each exponent we get: (5*5*5*5*5*5*5)/(5*5) Two of the fives in the numerator will cancel out with the two fives in the denominator, which leaves us with: 5*5*5*5*5 To write this with exponents, we just count up the number of fives - there happen to be 5 of them - so the simplified answer is 5^5. This simplification works with all exponential expressions where the base is the same for each term. If the base is different, no simplification can be done. Let's try another example. Simplify (y^8)/(y^6) Just like before, to simplify this expression like before, just subtract the exponents: 8 - 6 = 2, so (y^8)/(y^6) = y^2 The rule also applies if one or more of the exponents are negative. Simplify (b^-2)/(b^6) Again, just subtract the exponents, making sure to subtract them in the proper order. -2 - 6 = -8 so (b^-2)*(b^6) = b^-8 What if the Terms Have Different Bases? If the terms you are working with have different bases, there is not much you can do to simplify the expression. For example, Simplify (c^12) / (4^7) × Unlock Content Over 10,000 lessons in all major subjects Get FREE access for 5 days, just create an account. Start a FREE trial No obligation, cancel anytime.

Select a subject to preview related courses: Math History English ACT/SAT Science Business Psychology AP Since the bases for each term (c and 4) are different, nothing can be done to simplify this expression, and you are left with (c^12) / (4^7). Simplify (x^5)/(2^3) The same rule applies to this example. Because the bases are not the same, nothing can be done to simplify the expression. The answer is (x^5)/(2^3). The only exception to this rule is if both the bases are numbers. Then, to simplify, you can simplify each term and then divide. Simplify (4^3) / (2^3) 4^3 = 64 and 2^3 = 8 You can simplify further and then divide. 64/8 = 8 Lesson Summary Exponents are numbers written as superscripts that tell you how many times to multiply the base number to itself. In order to divide one exponential expression by another with the same base, you just need to subtract the exponents. This works if the exponents are positive or negative, but only if the bases are the same. If the terms have different bases, there is not much that can be done to simplify the expression.
