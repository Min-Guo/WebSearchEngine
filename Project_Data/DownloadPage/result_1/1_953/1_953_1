When the body is under attack by super-villains like bacteria and viruses, monocytes show up to save the day!  These superheroes are the largest and most powerful white blood cells in the human immune system. One of their special attacks is transforming into a macrophage, which allows them to 'munch' on the bad guys. They also use parts of the invading bacteria as a signal to other white blood cells. This announces that there is danger, and creates a team of super-hero defense! Learn More: http://bit.ly/1N5QJNM﻿Read moreShow less Study.com's photos 6 Add a comment... Study.comShared publicly  -  2015-07-31   Look up in the sky tonight to see a ‪#‎BlueMoon‬! A blue moon is the second full moon in a month and only occurs once every 2 to 3 years. This is where the term 'once in a blue moon' to refer to something uncommon, comes from. Did you know there's also a black moon? This is the second new moon in a month. It's not talked about as much because you can't actually see a black moon. You probably know the phases of the moon pretty well, but are you aware of the various theories for how it formed? Check out these moon theories and let us know if you think the Earth's gravity captured the moon, it was made from the remnants of a Mars sized object collision, or something else entirely: http://bit.ly/1LVuED1﻿Read moreShow less Study.com's photos 8 2 1 comment Darryl Moore + 0 1 0 Reply   Ok﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

There are three major types of volcanoes, based on their explosive style: composite cone, shield, and cinder cone. Composite cone volcanoes are cone-shaped volcanoes composed of layers of lava, ash and rock debris. Composite cone volcanoes can grow to heights of 8,000 feet or more and have explosive eruptions. One famous composite cone volcano is Mount Vesuvius, which buried the Roman village of Pompeii in ash almost 2,000 years ago.

About a month later, she was shipped to Auschwitz and killed.  By this time, 6,000 people at the camp were being murdered per day. Frank's diary survived, however, and is considered by many to be a literary masterpiece. The diary, published as "Diary of a Young Girl," chronicles Anne's thoughts, dreams, and hopes, and paints a vivid picture of what it was like to grow up during one of the cruelest, ugliest times in human history. http://bit.ly/1E6KnIM﻿Read moreShow less Study.com's photos 10 1 1 comment Susan Manthata + 1 2 1 Reply   dear study .com, may u kindly terminate my subscribtion till further notice,iam currently battling  financially thank you.contact me at +27827188229.susan.manthata2gmail.com﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

Newton was inspired when he was sitting in a garden and noticed an apple falling from a tree in 1666. His universal law of gravitation and equation has passed the test of science and physics for hundreds of years! http://bit.ly/1hfY0k8﻿Read moreShow less Study.com's photos 7 1 comment Damonica Jones + 0 1 0 Reply   So did the great Africans of the NORTH which is now called Egypt, they were able to create pyramids, statute, algebraic equations before hand.﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

The 14th Amendment was one of the 3 Reconstruction Amendments which were ratified to establish political equality for all Americans. The 13th abolished slavery within the US and its territories. The 15th prohibited disenfranchisement based on 'race, color, or previous condition of servitude', but it didn't prohibit poll taxes, literacy tests, or gender discrimination at the polls.  It wasn't until nearly a century later that all American men and women could truly exercise the right to vote.
