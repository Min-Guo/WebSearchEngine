Rachel Patterson Always a super useful report and survey results. Looking forward to reviewing this new edition! Shai Geoola This is why I find myself coming back to Social Media Examiner. An endless amount of value and knowledge provided by some of the greatest minds ever. Cheers! Kimberley Shepherd Do you have the previous reports available to download? It would be super useful for me to compare! üôÇ Michael A. Stelzner Thanks Shai! Michael A. Stelzner Glad you find it helpful Rachel Michael A. Stelzner Hey Kimberly ‚Äì We identify all the relevant changes in this report from last year. But you can Google and find the old ones rather easily. Diana Steinberg As we can see from the featured study, when marketers were asked to select the single most important form of content for their business, responses varied greatly depending upon the type of company he or she is representing. For instance, blogging is more important for business-to-business (B2B) marketers, with 57% claiming that it is the most important form, than to business-to-consumer (B2C) companies, with only 39% saying that it is most significant. Essentially, how a company determines which marketing tool to use is typically based upon the demographic it‚Äôs trying to reach, the type of products and/or services offered, the goal of communication, and respective corporate culture. While blogging is not optimal for all companies, according to the 2015 Social Media Marketing Industry Report, the written word is still important overall for marketers. In fact, a substantial 69% plan on increasing their use of blogs this year. Blogging, like all social media practices, is best determined by the company, culture and resources. With more than half of the marketers surveyed intending to expand their blog presence, it is important that it is done correctly and aligned with strategic business priorities. A company blog should be loosely based on the company itself, as it is unnecessary to talk about a product or service to sell it. For all blogs, it is most effective to have a broad range of topics. Effective areas of focus includes, but is not limited to, customers, the industry, and current trends, as well as proving readers with exclusive content that cannot be obtained anywhere else. Ultimately, through simply educating or entertaining audiences, a company has a greater propensity to increase sales through cultivating trustworthy relationships. Kimberley Shepherd Awesome thanks, Michael. Don‚Äôt know why a google search wasn‚Äôt the first thing I tried! üòõ Doh! Michael A. Stelzner I agree that blogs are still very important Diana üôÇ Andrew Salmon 82% of marketers have no intention of incorporating Snapchat into their marketing efforts. Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised. Michael A. Stelzner I‚Äôm sure over the years that stat will change Andrew Jeannette Paladino Thanks, again for this important report. Congratulations, Michael, in making Social Media Examine must reading. I learn so much for your daily newsletters. Michael A. Stelzner Thanks so much Jeannette! Mwebya Fred Great report, I guess this report is going to be very helpful to African Businesses. I am very thankful to Michael for always enabling us achieve the best out of Social Media Dan Jackson Is there any way i can get this in like a book format? Not something I particularly want to read from a computer. Thanks a lot for all the great content. Michael A. Stelzner Thanks Fred Michael A. Stelzner Hey Dan ‚Äì You can always print it out. There will not be a print copy you can purchase. viewsxew Hi Michael ‚Äì I‚Äôm not sure how others are able to comment on the Report: in Australia I don‚Äôt get the drop down menu you show above on my PC; the video clip above doesn‚Äôt open to full screen; and apart from listening to the audio from that video I have no way of seeing the detail of the report. I‚Äôm sure it is an excellent report ‚Äì and I‚Äôll look for another opportunity to download it. Best wishes, Stuart Armstrong Michael, Thanks, that‚Äôs a very informative report/survey and with 3700 participants-statistically strong (imho) (ie self employed, SMB, B2C, mid-large firms, many industries,etc. Question- re LinkedIN. Company profiles have not increased for over 18 months. ie for the US market there are approx 410,000 LinkedIN company profiles for companies between 10- 1000 employees versus about a total of 1.8Million companies in this cohort. This has not grown at all. Survey says B2B marketeers will increase use of LinkedIN for ads, recruiting, sales leads etc. Curious to know why LinkedIN company profiles in the SMB- mid-market space have not grown while personal profiles are heading to 350 million. regards, and thanks, Hal Thomas Is it fair to say that the respondents to the survey include both brand side and independent (i.e. agencies, consultants, etc.) marketers? And if so, any idea what the split is? Michael A. Stelzner Hal ‚Äì We actually asked agencies to not answer on behalf of their clients but instead their own business. If you look at the end of the report you will see the breakdown on size of businesses and industries. Michael A. Stelzner Hey Stuart ‚Äì I guess it depends on how you look at it. If by growth you mean the number of new businesses that have company profiles then you could say that this is a problem. However I think that is a bad metric. I would say that simply setting up a LinkedIn Company Page has zero correlation to increasing LinkedIn activities. There are obviously a very finite number of businesses that would have a page and a much bigger pool of employees who do not own a business. Michael A. Stelzner Have another look as there is both a link above to the PDF file and an embedded copy. Hal Thomas Thanks, Michael. I see that now. Don‚Äôt know how I missed it earlier. Michael A. Stelzner Thanks Anton ‚Äì I agree that is interesting viewsxew Thanks ‚Äì but still no success: I‚Äôll leave it for now; perhaps next year ElenaJDisanto ‚åò‚åò‚åò‚åò‚Äî‚Äì.‚úà‚úà‚úà‚úà‚åòcan you like examiner < http://www.NetCash9.Com ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. Michael A. Stelzner Very unusual. Don Stanley Thank you Michael and the rest of the SME staff for putting this together. I‚Äôll be using it in my business but it‚Äôs also excellent timing for me because I will be making this required reading for the summer school social media marketing class I‚Äôm teaching that starts on June 1st. Can wait to introduce a new crop of students to SME! Michael A. Stelzner Wow cool Don üôÇ All my best to you and your students Stuart Armstrong Michael, thanks for reply. Agreed, overall not a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù for LinkedIN (I‚Äôll take their problems any day). LinkedIN has so many other social collaboration tools, groups etc in addition to the ‚Äúcompany profile page‚Äù but since I have been active since 2006 I was puzzled to notice little growth last 18 months. However having 410K companies from 10-1000 employees out of a total US cohort of approx. 1.9MM is pretty damm good (95% with accurate data, etc.). Perhaps companies who do provide profiles and the employees linked to them are being bombarded with sales/marketing messages etc., and maybe we are killing our collective golden goose. regards, SA Taiwo O. Amazing and important stuff from SME, I find it very interesting that so many are planning on increasing their Online marketing efforts and want to learn more about it. more grace and Wisdom to you all @ SME. Michael A. Stelzner Thanks Taiwo ‚Äì It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that people want to increase their social media marketing efforts Cypher ‚Äì Mass Planner Awesome Share Burkay The best platform to get insights about social media‚Ä¶ I really appreciate your reports,news !

I listened to the Video and was impressed and would like to clearly see your charts. Thanks for any help you can offer. Angharad Llewellyn Angharad Llewellyn Hi, I‚Äôm ammending my quesions from my previous post. I Googled this report and was able to download the whole thing. Therefore, my previous question is moot. Great report! It will take me some times to digest it. Thanks, Angharad Llewellyn Sanjay Dogra this is very good article and very usefull , i have a website for online marketing in austrlaia , when i rec this project , its total weekly sale is 600$ to 700 $ but my work it is 3200$ per weekly and this is possible only SEO and Social media marketing. Thankyou Social Media Marketing and SEO. Bhautik Sheth Hope to get some insights for Indian market in next reports. Robbin Block Some useful data here, although not surprising, especially the split between FB and Li, B2C vs. B2B. Social can increase website traffic, but what I‚Äôm wondering about is how your respondents measure exposure? Karla McDougall Hi Michael, excellent report! Great insight into the ways businesses are using social media and content marketing. I would like to use this report as a source on a piece I‚Äôm working on about the B2B sector and wondered what percentage of B2B marketers surveyed answered the question of what single form of content is most important for their business with video and podcasting (page 44). The data is given for blogging and visual, but not these choices. Hope you can help me with this! Thanks, Karla Michael A. Stelzner Good question Robbin, not sure Michael A. Stelzner Hey Karla ‚Äì It‚Äôs because there was not a statistically significant difference in B2B and B2C on those segments. Hope this helps. Angie Brown-Peterson I am using parts of your report in my dissertation! Did you conduct any reliability or validity tests for your surveys? Thank you for this great information! Tayla_Flint Thanks for compiling such a comprehensive book on the industry. It can be quite difficult to figure out which SM platform to spend your time and money on. This certainly cuts through the clutter. Holasoymin Hi, I couldn‚Äôt see how global or local this report is, I find it very helpful but I‚Äôm not sure if this data expresses my local (country-region) targets behavior. Rodney wish i could harness all this information for internet radio FP how much of your research is ad based versus post based? Nataly Hi, have anyone an idea for research question for my master Thesis in Social Media (Corporate Communication) Thank you in advance ## Judah Hey Michael.
