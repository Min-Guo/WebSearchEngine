Florida Board of Hearing Aid Specialists Search Posts, Pages & FAQs: FAQs Contact Sitemap Friday, April 15th, 2016 Home Licensing Renewals Resources Meetings The Board Continuing Education – CE   To find profession specific Continuing Education requirements, please visit Renewals and choose from the list of professions provided. Click on Requirements, then select the “CE” tab on the requirements page. Renewals →Are You Renewal Ready?FAQs → The Department of Health, Division of Medical Quality Assurance, will now review your continuing education records in the electronic tracking system at the time of renewal. It will happen automatically when you renew your license, but it is important that you understand how this simple change will affect the way you renew your license in the future. If the practitioner’s continuing education records are complete, they will be able to renew their license without interruption. If the practitioner’s continuing education records are not complete, they will be prompted to enter their remaining continuing education hours before proceeding with their license renewal. Continuing Education Reporting Account Types The Department’s Continuing Education Tracking system is powered by CEBroker FREE “Just The Basics” Account – This account provides all the necessary tools for you to comply with the departments reporting requirements. You can view your basic course history, which will list the course name, educational provider name, date of completion and hours reported. It would then be up to you to determine whether all of the courses that have been reported will complete all of your specific continuing education requirements. You can also self-report any continuing education that may be missing. Free Account → Professional Account (Paid Subscription – Optional) – This account provides you with all of the tracking tools that CE Broker offers. Your transcript will display what your specific CE requirements are and will calculate what requirements have been met and what may still be outstanding. A Professional Account is a subscription service and is not a requirement but it can be a useful tool in managing your Florida continuing education requirements should you chose to subscribe. This account offers a 7 day Free Trial. This is NOT the FREE account. Professional Account → Please refer to Rule 64B6-5, F.A.C. for additional continuing education information.
