Advertising Editorial Reviews From the Publisher "Melissa shares how to be content and happy in our home, inspiring our home with the things we love and the people we cherish." —Ann Voskamp, New York Times bestselling author of One Thousand Gifts "Melissa Michaels' book The Inspired Room is full of smart, practical advice and packed with inspiration to spare. The photos are gorgeous and accompanied by helpful tips and details, and the writing lifts you up and makes you excited to dive into home decor headfirst!" —Sherry Petersik, New York Times bestselling author of Young House Love "I just love Melissa's approach to decorating to give yourself time to let the process of decorating happen in your home, give yourself grace, and enjoy the process. She really speaks to my heart and brings out the best in me when it comes to my home." —Rachel Dowd, Sweet and Simple Home "I've read The Inspired Room cover to cover, and it's going to be one of the most useful books I've ever owned. Melissa is a great teacher, and designer, and is so very humble, and she just has that 'you can do it' spirit about her." —Sandy Coughlin, Reluctant Entertainer "Love the Home You Have is what all overwhelmed moms need—confirmation that they can find joy in the small things no matter the size of their home or the amount of stuff they have (or do not have)." —Susan Heid, The Confident Mom "Love the Home You Have speaks not only to the well-organized mom who wants to create a beautiful and lovely home, but to the disorganized, stressed, often-overwhelmed mom (me) who just needs some reassurance about what a home truly is. Melissa has a passion for life and beauty that translates into one of the best (and most needed) books I have read in a long time. Well done!" —Amanda Rettke, I Am Baker "Melissa feels it's important to 'use what quality pieces you have to become the building blocks for your style.' There are so many welcome tips in The Inspired Room to help guide you when uncertainty with your decorating process steps in. The helpful hints prod you to gently move forward with your changes but remind you to stay true to yourself and your family. I love that." —Kristy Wicks, KristyWicks.com "If you are stressing out about how your home looks and feels and want to make it the best it can be, then Love the Home You Have is the book for you. It doesn't matter if you live in a tiny basement apartment or a grand, 5,000-square-foot home. The ideas and tips Melissa shares can be done by anyone, in any decorating style, and even on the tiniest of budgets." —Diane Henkler, In My Own Style "After reading Love the Home You Have, I've felt an overwhelming sense of contentment and joy in my home. Melissa has a way with words that really changes the way you think and leaves you with inspiration (true tips to put into place!) to make it a lasting feeling!" —Corinna Henderson, A Designer at Home "Melissa puts into words so many simple, straightforward, real-life, functional ways to embrace your home. Plus, her ideas include and account for children, pets, and even sometimes husbands!
