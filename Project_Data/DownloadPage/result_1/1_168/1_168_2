Â Â Â Â Â  by KK7AV Walk into the Apple Store. Grab something off the shelf. Open this app and use it to scan the barcode. Select pay with Apple Pay. Done! No waiting and no interaction with anyone... Your receipt is in your inbox before you can make it out the door. Amazing! Of course the first couple of times you might feel a little odd just walking out of the store with your item in hand but with the electronic receipt on your screen ready to show anybody that cares, you're all set. ðŸ˜Š 9.3 update Â Â Â Â Â  by Stomlinson2 I agree please when you update our iPod touches from 9.2.1 please add security for our most personal files such as photos and screenshots. Like Samsung has KNOX. My iPod is my safest most secure device. The FBI can't even get in. They don't need to its no ones business what's on our devices. Not everyone's a criminal like they say. But criminals do sneak on our devices and extra security for us who want it for Photos and personal files like mcafee uses VAULT. Same thing. Come on Apple get it together your slacking. Lol 9.3.1 Worst Upgrade Â Â Â Â Â  by Shywulff If you own an iPad Mini 2, don't upgrade to 9.3.1. It will make anything you do take a long time to complete. Typing text, opening apps, accessing Internet all are VERY slow. Some apps crash often, like Facebook. If you leave an app to check something quickly then go back, the app will restart putting you ba k to the beginning. From the complaints I've read, it seems like every iPad Mini 2 owner has these problems and more. I tried dealing with Apple's tech support. After an hour I was to,d the problem was with my iPad. I have to wonder if they even care.
