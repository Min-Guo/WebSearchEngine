Home Find MRC Unit Details Bay Area Medical Reserve Corps ( 225 ) Profile: The Medical Reserve Corps was created along with Homeland Security in response to the devastating events on September 11, 2001 and the anthrax scare that shortly followed. It is the mission of the National Medical Reserve Corps to train, prepare, and mobilize teams of volunteer civilian medical professionals to respond during emergencies and disasters. Locally, the Bay Area Medical Reserve Corps does this by providing education, trainings, exercises, and mobilization events within the community. During the 2012-2013 fiscal year, the Bay Area Medical Reserve Corps has experienced tremendous growth and service opportunities; membership has increased by 65 percent. Some exciting highlights include participation in the Feast of the South Indigenous Women Drum Circle Event, Bay Medical Center’s Carnival Cruise Ship Full Scale Exercise, The Bays Medical Society Spring Symposium, The American Red Cross Emergency Preparedness Expo, as well as the Women’s Expo. The Bay Area Medical Reserve also planned and executed the “Know Your Numbers: Florida Health Spring Tour.” During this mass prophylaxis preparation exercise, MRC volunteers as well as Florida Department of Health in Bay County staff screened over 1000 individuals for diabetes. We have strengthened partnerships with the Emergency Operations Center, the Bays Medical Society, local hospitals and the American Red Cross. New partnerships have been established with the Civil Air Patrol, Gulf Coast State Collage Nursing Program, the Community Health Task Force, and the Teen Outreach Program. As the Bay County Area MRC is developed, members will be given the opportunity for training on the Incident Command System and related areas. A diverse base of trained volunteers will result in Bay County area being able to effectively deal with medical situations created by future natural disasters and terrorist events. Volunteers will have varying interests and levels of involvement, and we look forward to making this a rewarding experience to all involved.
