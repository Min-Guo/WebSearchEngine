The tradition of championships began quickly and has since been part of every era of the franchise, regardless of location or what name they have gone by. That success has led to the team's fervent fan base and the lengths that people will go to in order to get Los Angeles Lakers tickets. Founded in 1947 in Detroit, Michigan, as part of the NBL, the team joined the NBA in 1948. The real story began for the franchise when they were known as the Minneapolis Lakers, based out of Minneapolis, Minnesota. As their Minneapolis incarnation; the Lakers won their first five league championships. Then in 1960, the team relocated to Los Angeles, where they became home to some of the most cherished players in the league. In Los Angeles the team has gone from winning in the 70s and 80s, to winning in the 00s. Kobe Bryant has become synonymous with the Los Angeles Lakers name, along with other notable players like Dwight Howard, Pau Gasol and Steve Nash who have worked to take the team to its accustomed perch atop the NBA. The winning tradition means the Lakers have some stiff rivalries with teams like the Boston Celtics. When the Lakers take the court at Staples Center, exciting basketball is about to happen!
