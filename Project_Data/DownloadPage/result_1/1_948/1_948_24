Scan of 501(c)(3) status letter Netherlands Dutch tax authorities have confirmed that, under Dutch law, the Wikimedia Foundation qualifies as a "public welfare institution" (in Dutch, “algemeen nut beogende instelling” or “ANBI”). This classification means that, if you are a Dutch resident, any donations made to the Wikimedia Foundation are deductible from your income tax subject to the normal tax rules on the donations deduction under Dutch tax legislation. Importantly, the Wikimedia Foundation does not seek donations from persons or entities located in any jurisdiction that prohibits or restricts fundraising activities by international charities or applies gift taxes on donations made to such international charities. The Wikimedia Foundation is a non-profit charity established in the United States under the U.S. IRS Code Section 501(c)(3).
