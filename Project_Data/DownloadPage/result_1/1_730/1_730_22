Things you should see and know. Curated by Julia Carpenter. Home About this Tumblr Overheard Blogs to Follow Ask Archive smithsonianlibraries: In the wee hours of Wednesday morning, North America, Australia, western Asia and most of the Pacific Ocean will be treated to a full lunar eclipse in which the moon takes on a reddish hue as it passes through the Earth’s shadow. We borrowed this moon image from The moon hoax, or a discovery that the moon has a vast population of human beings, an 1859 book that compiled the original six articles published in The Sun in 1835. A century before H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds induced panic about a Martian invasion of New Jersey, these six articles helped grow The Sun’s readership dramatically and establish it as a major New York newspaper. Read more about the fascinating history of The Great Moon Hoax on our blog. Rather listen to a podcast? The memory palace has an episode that might be of interest.

However, if the U.S. gives women equal hours, pay and positions, it stands to add an extra $4.3 trillion to that $4.9 trillion figure. How we can do it.
