The former Duke standout spent his rookie season across the bay from his superstar sibling, leading the Santa Cruz Warriors to the 2014 NBA D-League Finals. Curry followed that with a sensational second season with the Erie BayHawks, when he ranked second in the league in scoring (23.8 PPG), first in three-pointers made (3.6 per game) and first in three-point shooting percentage (47%). Take a look inside the workouts that helped Curry reach the next level:             Hit the Gym with BayHawks Big Man Alex Davis The Erie BayHawks and their rising forward, Alex Davis, run through the workout routine that helps them prepare for the 50-game grind of an NBA D-League season.     Shootaround with “Mr. Mad Ant” Ron Howard After making the Mad Ants through an open tryout, Ron Howard became a fixture in Fort Wayne for seven seasons. “Mr. Mad Ant” finished his final season as the NBA Development League’s all-time leading scorer before being surpassed by Bakersfield Jam vet Renaldo Major last season. Get a glimpse the pregame shooting drills that made Howard one of the league’s most consistent scoring threats: Copyright 2016 NBA D-League Media Ventures, LLC. All rights reserved.
