Skip to posts Advocacy for Animals Home About Us Comment Policy Contact Us Action Alert from the National Anti-Vivisection Society April 14, 2016 No comments Tweet — Each week the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) sends out a “Take Action Thursday” email alert, which tells subscribers about current actions they can take to help animals. NAVS is a national, not-for-profit educational organization incorporated in the State of Illinois. NAVS promotes greater compassion, respect, and justice for animals through educational programs based on respected ethical and scientific theory and supported by extensive documentation of the cruelty and waste of vivisection. You can register to receive these action alerts and more at the NAVS Web site. This week’s Take Action Thursday urges support of humane farming practices in several states. It also reports on Walmart’s decision to phase out the sale of eggs from caged hens. State Legislation Commercial farming practices commonly involve inhumane confinement of breeding pigs, calves used for veal and laying hens. These animals suffer unnecessarily when they cannot turn around, stretch or move their bodies outside a very small space. Confinement farming often leads to an increase in diseases in these animals. As a result of these conditions, antibiotics are added to the animals’ feed to keep them healthy. These drugs are then passed on to humans, who may develop antibiotic resistance as a result. The following states have introduced legislation to end cruel confinement farming practices for breeding pigs, calves raised for veal and laying hens. If you live in one of these states, please take action to support humane farming initiatives. Massachusetts, H 3930 New York, S 3999 North Carolina, HB 655 A different type of legislative action, from Missouri, demands that California repeal its restrictions on battery cages for laying hens. In Missouri, House Concurrent Resolution 101 seeks to undermine provisions adopted by California in 2008 when it passed Proposition 2 concerning the welfare of laying hens. The Missouri Resolution challenges the legality of California’s law and condemns as anti-trade its mandate that all eggs sold in the state be raised in accordance with California’s more humane standards. If you live in Missouri, please contact your state Representative and ask him/her to OPPOSE efforts to undermine California’s more humane laws. Legal Trends While legislative progress to promote cage-free egg production has been slow on a state-by-state basis, efforts by consumers to convince major egg suppliers to change their policies on eggs have gained momentum. Last week, Walmart, the nation’s largest grocery store chain, announced that it will exclusively sell cage-free eggs by 2025. Its new guidelines will apply to all of its stores in the United States, including its Sam’s Club warehouses. This change could signify a shift in the food industry as a whole to more humane egg production. Walmart follows several other major food retailers and restaurants in phasing out eggs from caged hens including McDonald’s, Burger King, Kroger, Costco, Trader Joe’s and Starbucks. Though cage-free eggs have often been pricier than other options, Walmart claims that as cage-free eggs shift from a specialty product to an industry standard, retailers will reflect these changes in customer pricing. Action can be taken through Change.org to urge Publix, a Florida-based grocery chain, to follow Walmart’s lead and take a pledge to sell eggs only from cage-free hens.

News flash: Climate change imperils wolverines and Feds must act! That’s the recent headline from ABC news, reporting on court proceedings in Missoula, Montana. On Monday, April 4th, “U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen ordered wildlife officials to act as quickly as possible to protect the species as it becomes vulnerable to a warming planet.” Wolverine–Daniel J. Cox/NaturalExposures.com via AP.Cue the climate change deniers and those who don’t know much of anything about wolverines: “Wolverines are tough animals. I really don’t think ‘climate change’ is anything they can’t handle,” said one commenter at the Missoulian Facebook page.“There is no evidence suggesting that wolverines will not adapt sufficiently to diminished late spring snow pack (assuming there is any) to maintain viability,” wrote Wyoming governor Matt Mead back in May of 2013 (in the Northern Rockies, Montana and Idaho also opposed listing). But snow joke–snow matters. Wolverines are obligate snow denners who require remote, deep, and usually high elevations snow fields that persist well into spring. This is where natal and maternal dens enable them to birth and raise their young–in other words, enable them to survive. Flash back to Feb. 4, 2013, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (henceforth FWS) proposed listing the North American wolverine as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The final determination would be made in one year, “based on the best available science.” A year later, FWS extended the comment deadline by six months “to further evaluate areas of scientific disagreement and uncertainty as they relate to the wolverine listing decision” (2/4/14 news release). At issue: “some peer reviewers questioned the information we used to describe wolverine habitat, and estimates of the likely impacts to wolverine habitat from future climate change.” Oh, and did I mention that the states were unhappy? Montana, in fact, was poised to offer its annual wolverine trapping season as recently as the winter of 2012-13; it was halted–the day before the season was to open–by a district judge. Subsequent to the extended comment deadline and in response to “peer review and state comments we received after publication of the proposed rule to list wolverines,” FWS convened a wolverine science panel on April 3-4, 2014 (findings here). Then, on August 13, 2014, FWS officially reversed itself, withdrawing its proposal to list the wolverine as ‘threatened’ in the contiguous states: While it is clear that the climate is warming, after carefully considering the best available science, the Service has determined that the effects of climate change are not likely to place the wolverine in danger of extinction now or in the foreseeable future. As a result, the wolverine does not meet the statutory definition of either a “threatened species” or an “endangered species” and does not warrant protection under the ESA (source). That’s the story in a nutshell–oh, except for the leaked memo! According to a leaked memo obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity, scientists with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have been ordered to reverse their own conclusions and withdraw last year’s proposal to protect American wolverines under the Endangered Species Act (7/7/14 CBD news release). A broad coalition of conservation groups challenged FWS’s refusal to protect imperiled wolverines, and that challenge was met with victory on Monday in Missoula. (Read the decision here, courtesy of the Western Environmental Law Center. View the original complaint here.) According to the Wolverine Blog, “the court ruling does not require the USFWS to grant wolverines protected status under the Endangered Species Act, but it does find that the USFWS discounted the best available science and applied unnecessarily stringent standards of scientific certainty and precision in reaching the decision not to list.” Now FWS must reconsider its decision to forego protecting Gulo gulo—this time actually using the best available science instead of caving to political pressure from Western states and their henchmen Farm Bureaus and snowmobile associations. “Gulo” is Latin for glutton, referring to the wolverine’s voracious appetite. But the skunk bear has no appetite for politics…that falls to his human allies. Thankfully, they’ve proven every bit as tenacious and muscular as the wolverine when it comes to protecting the magnificent mustelid. ____________________________________________________________ Learn more: A world first: footage of wild wolverine kits as mom moves them from den to den. “Leaked federal memo orders biologists to abandon wolverine protection,” KCET.

Happy Birthday to the ASPCA! The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) was one of the earliest organizations to publicize and work toward the abolition of cruel treatment of animals. These included horses and other work animals, dogs, cats, pigeons, and any other animal that found itself in the care of—or subject to use by—human beings. Founded in New York City in the 1860s by Henry Bergh, a well-to-do man who was troubled and appalled by the treatment of “these mute servants of mankind,” the ASPCA has continued and expanded upon Bergh’s work in the century and a half since its beginning. Bergh was born New York in 1813 to a wealthy family and as an adult traveled the world, sometimes living in Europe. Appointed by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863 to a diplomatic position in Russia, Bergh was disturbed by incidents of cruelty to animals he witnessed there and elsewhere in Europe; such sights were also commonplace in the United States. A great admirer of horses in particular, he determined to work to obtain mercy and justice for animals. In London he consulted with the earl of Harrowby, president of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Once back in the United States, Bergh spoke out about the suffering of animals—for example, in bullfights, cockfights, and slaughterhouses and in everyday incidents, such as the beating of horses, that took place on the streets. He created a Declaration of the Rights of Animals and persuaded many influential people to sign it. These consciousness-raising efforts paved the way for his foundation of the ASPCA in 1866, when it received its charter from the New York state legislature. Days later the legislature passed anti-cruelty legislation, and the ASPCA was granted authority to enforce it. ASPCA behaviorists work with a dog available for adoption–© Chet Burger/ASPCASince that time laws regulating the treatment of animals have been passed in many countries—in the United States, at all levels of government—and the animal protection movement has grown exponentially, yet such cruelty as Bergh spoke out against continues. Laws against animal cruelty are not often enforced to their fullest extent. It takes the energy and efforts of caring citizens and of groups like the ASPCA to make sure that lawbreakers are prosecuted and animals protected. continue reading… Advocates for Animals, Animal Rights, Books We Like, Legal Issues, Organizations, Pets and Companions, Posts Adoption, Animal shelters, ASPCA, Henry Bergh, New York City Read more Neuter the Puppy Mills April 8, 2016 1 comment Tweet — Our thanks to the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) for permission to republish this post, which originally appeared on the ALDF Blog on April 5, 2016. Earlier this year, ALDF sent an undercover investigator to capture video at a puppy mill in McIntosh, New Mexico—Southern Roc Airedales—after receiving multiple complaints from the facility’s customers and visitors. The video showed deplorable conditions: uncollected feces, dirty drinking water green with algae, often frozen, all in a tragic shantytown shelter where temperatures fall below 30 degrees at night. Trash and debris litter the “breeding facility,” while dogs with dirty matted fur visibly shiver in desolate pens. In sum, our investigator witnessed and recorded multiple, significant violations of the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). Airedale. Image courtesy ALDF. And still, in this heartbreaking setting, perfectly indicative of the operation’s priorities and motivations, Southern Roc’s representative offered to sell our investigator an Airedale puppy for $1,000. Sadly, the state of Southern Roc’s facility is all too typical. In fact, relative to other, larger puppy mills uncovered in the U.S., the conditions at Southern Roc’s operations are far from the worst. Contrary to common expectation, breeders in the US operate with little actual oversight or enforced regulation. Endorsements like “AKC registered” or “USDA licensed” mean next to nothing, especially about the quantity of dogs kenneled within an operation or about the quality of the care they receive after they enter the world. continue reading… Advocates for Animals, Legal Issues, Partner Blogs, Pets and Companions, Posts American Kennel Club, Animal abuse, Animal cruelty, Animal hoarding, Animal neglect, Animal Welfare Act, Breeders, Dogs, Puppy mills, USDA Read more Action Alert from the National Anti-Vivisection Society April 7, 2016 No comments Tweet — Each week the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS) sends out a “Take Action Thursday” email alert, which tells subscribers about current actions they can take to help animals. NAVS is a national, not-for-profit educational organization incorporated in the State of Illinois. NAVS promotes greater compassion, respect, and justice for animals through educational programs based on respected ethical and scientific theory and supported by extensive documentation of the cruelty and waste of vivisection. You can register to receive these action alerts and more at the NAVS Web site. This week’s Take Action Thursday calls for action to permanently stop the sale of cats and dogs for research, education, and testing by random source, or “class B,” animal dealers. Federal Regulation The Consolidated Appropriations Act, which authorizes federal government spending through September 30, 2016, includes a measure that prohibits any funds from being used to support class B animal dealers selling dogs and cats for research. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has issued a notice to all class B dealers that any new or renewed license for this fiscal year will note: “Due to a recent change in the law, please be aware that you may not use this class B dealer’s license to sell dogs or cats for use in research, experiments, teaching, or testing.” While this limitation on the activities of class B animal dealers is welcome, the authorization expires on October 1, 2016, at which point class B dealers can resume these activities—unless further action is taken (see “Federal Legislation” below). Federal Legislation The Pet Safety and Protection Act, HR 2849, would amend the Animal Welfare Act to prohibit research facilities from using animals obtained from class B dealers. It would end the use of cats and dogs from various sources, including animal shelters and owner giveaways, as well as animals allegedly obtained through misrepresentation or theft. While the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has stopped funding the purchase of dogs and cats from class B dealers, researchers who do not receive NIH funding are still keeping a handful of dealers in business. Now is the time to pass legislation to make this year’s federal restriction on the appropriation of funds for class B dealers permanent. Please contact your U.S. Representative and ask them to SUPPORT this bill. Legal Trends Ending the sale of cats and dogs from class B animal dealers has been sought by animal advocates for decades. The decision by the NIH to stop using these dealers as a source for animals, coupled with legislation that would end the licensing of class B dealers for the sale of research animals permanently, could mean that the end is in sight. Unfortunately, this seeming success has another less fortunate side. The cover story in the spring edition of NAVS’ Animal Action, “Dog Gone? Not So Fast,” explains how the NIH’s decision to abandon the use of class B dogs has resulted in an increase in the number of dogs being bred for research in their place. NAVS continues to work on strategies for the replacement of all dogs and cats for research, testing and education.
