Since that time, NEHA has developed additional credentials that evidence mastery of specialized knowledge. NEHA is striving to make the credentialing process as convenient as possible.   These marks of distinction assist both employers and the credentialed individual. Employers can be confident that a credentialed employee has acquired the knowledge necessary to competently perform their duties. Credentialed individuals may find positions easier to obtain and may increase their earnings.   Registered Environmental Health Specialist/Registered Sanitarian (REHS/RS) Credential The REHS/RS is the premiere NEHA credential.
