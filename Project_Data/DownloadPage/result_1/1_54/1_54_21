Uhlář2 1 Astronomical Institute, Charles University, Prague, V Holešovičkách 2, 18000 Prague 8, Czech Republic e-mail: zasche@sirrah.troja.mff.cuni.cz 2 Private Observatory, Pohoří 71, 25401 Jílové u Prahy, Czech Republic Received: 29 April 2010 Accepted: 12 July 2010 Abstract Aims. We present the detailed analysis of triple system KR Com with different observational techniques – photometry, interferometry, and period variation. Methods. The use of BVR photometry of the close-contact binary KR Com, which is the primary component of a triple system, helps us to better describe the properties of the components. The interferometric data obtained during the last 30 years sufficiently determine the visual orbit, but the use of minima timings of KR Com for the study of period variation together with the visual orbit is a novel approach in this system. Results. Basic physical parameters resulting from the light curve analysis agree well with the previous results from spectroscopy. The temperatures for the primary and secondary component resulted in 5549 and 6072 K, respectively, and the amount of the third light in all filters is about 1/3 of the total luminosity. The distant third component revolves around the common barycenter on 11 yr orbit with a very high eccentricity (0.934) and this movement is also detectable via the period variation, which is clearly visible in the O–C diagram of times of minima observations. The use of minima times for the combined analysis helps us to independently determine the distance to the system (64.02 ± 9.42 pc) and also to confirm the orientation of the orbit in space. Conclusions. New minima observations and also spectroscopy would be very profitable, especially during the next periastron passage in the year 2017.

The OpenURL standard is a protocol for transmission of metadata describing the resource that you wish to access. An OpenURL link contains article metadata and directs it to the OpenURL server of your choice. The OpenURL server can provide access to the resource and also offer complementary services (specific search engine, export of references...). The OpenURL link can be generated by different means. If your librarian has set up your subscription with an OpenURL resolver, OpenURL links appear automatically on the abstract pages. You can define your own OpenURL resolver with your EDPS Account. In this case your choice will be given priority over that of your library. You can use an add-on for your browser (Firefox or I.E.) to display OpenURL links on a page (see http://www.openly.com/openurlref/). You should disable this module if you wish to use the OpenURL server that you or your library have defined. Editor-in-Chief: T. Forveille Letters Editor-in-Chief: J. Alves Managing Editor: N.
