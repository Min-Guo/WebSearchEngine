The mission of the Florida Medical Reserve Corps network is to augment local community health and medical services staff with pre-identified, trained and credentialed MRC volunteers. The Medical Reserve Corps is a national volunteer program established after 9/11 by the U.S. Surgeon General. The MRC is dedicated to the pre-identification, advance preparation and credentialing of local health professionals to respond in large-scale medical or public health emergencies such as natural disasters, disease pandemics or acts of terrorism. How do corps volunteers help in disasters? The Florida Department of Health in Marion County manages the Marion County Medical Reserve Corps. Medical and non-medical volunteers are trained to be ready to respond to community health emergencies in a structured way. Volunteers serve alongside public health and emergency services professionals. They support special needs shelters, help in mass-dispensing of medication and vaccinations, aid disease outbreak investigations, and help in many other ways. Where do I register for the Medical Reserve Corps? Volunteer today! Complete the online Florida MRC Basic Volunteer Contact Form and a local MRC coordinator will contact you. You can find more information on the Department’s Medical Reserve Corps page Connect with DOH #HealthiestWeightFL 1 out of 3 kids are now considered overweight or obese. 65% of adults in Florida are at an unhealthy weight.
