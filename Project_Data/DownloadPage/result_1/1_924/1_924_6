I am continually impressed by the depth of the solution and the potential it offers my organization." Andrew Cullen Yamaha Motor Corporation | Marketing Communications Manager "Previously, our weekly promotional emails would cause our site to crash because so many of our subscribers would visit our website to purchase merchandise. Send Time Optimization was our savior because it eliminated this issue by automatically sending emails to our recipients based upon when they are most likely in their inbox. There was also a huge financial benefit, including a 10% increase in open rates and 12% increase in conversion rate." Tom Hassett Girl Scouts of the USA Assistant Director, Marketing "A successful social media presence is inextricably linked to email marketing, which means that emails need to also be engaging , relevant and personalised �� and personalised, dynamic automation is only possible using the Silverpop system." Brendon Macdonald ApexHub Founder “The speed and ease in which Silverpop allows the RSPCA to gather and segment our data, as well as send the campaign is important, especially in a small, busy digital communications team that is always looking for ways to help their colleagues meet their communication targets and achieve the highest possible ROI.”  Sarah Brown RSPCA Senior Digital Communications Officer “I definitely give Silverpop an “A.”  Compared to similar products, I’ve found anything I want to do is possible in Silverpop and easier to achieve.”  Mike Silva Dover Saddlery Email Marketing Specialist Overview Case Studies Video Testimonials Client Quotes Already an IBM Marketing Cloud Client?
