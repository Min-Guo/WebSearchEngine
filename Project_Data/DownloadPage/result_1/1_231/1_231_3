Read more My review Review from Abraham Uwana Abraham Uwana Error message, blank feed Hi McKinsey, for a while now, whenever I launch the app I get an error message, it usually takes a second launch to open. The issue however took a new twist; with my feed being totally empty, blank, nothing showing. When I try navigating the app I get a message saying I'm unconnected to that Internet, requesting I turn off airplane mode or connect to a WiFi. I uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it now returns an error message.

So frustrating that links in your emails do not detect the app and open in the app directly. Am met with a message every time asking me to download the app or view in a browser. Full Review Adrien Viala April 5, 2016 100% crash when opening app from notifications Quality of content varies steeply from one article to the other.

Simple tools such as pdf download and reading list are godsend. This is a must for anyone who is on the lookout for fresh knowledge/content from the world of industry, society and technology. Full Review Ayoola Stephen Efunkoya August 5, 2015 My best recommended app from Google Play. In under 12 hours since downloading it, I'm really enjoying it and the well-researched content it presents. I'm also happy I can download each article as PDF files for offline reading. I'm so impressed that this app works with the android accessibility suite, particularly the Talkback screen reader; any shortcoming with accessibility must be Android/device inflicted. I hope the app becomes more accessible or at least stays as it is. Nice job. Keep it up! Full Review Sami Faizullah January 5, 2016 Sign in Can't use the app until you sign in/sign up. Doesn't allow you to do so, throws an error. Uninstalled, sadly Full Review Abdulqader Lassas August 27, 2015 Very interesting & rich insights indeed . Unfortunately ,although I am still keeping my Samsung phone ,I am mostly using now a Microsoft Lumia phone (Windows phone ) .Can I download this app on my Lumia ? Full Review Debaditya Das August 12, 2015 Thoughtful insights McKinsey as the name says it all. Wonderful app that brings what you require to empower yourself in today's volatile world of business and competition. Go through the app and you will come to know why McKinsey is what McKinsey is. Full Review Chrissy Cox December 13, 2015 Fking good! One more suggestion would be to have more Insights, especially Editor's Choice! Basically more of this useful stuff available would be good!!
