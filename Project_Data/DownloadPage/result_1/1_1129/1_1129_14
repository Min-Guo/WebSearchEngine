Google DevelopersShared publicly  -  2016-04-14   Dart originally shared:   Here's the interview we promised earlier this week. We talked with Joshy Joseph, the primary tech lead on the new AdWords UI. Snip: > So a couple of years ago, when we were starting to think about building a new version of AdWords with much improved UI and performance, we took a fresh look at the tech stack. We wanted to use the opportunity to upgrade to a modern infrastructure that will serve us well for the next 7+ years. But do read the whole article and tell us what you think or what you'd like to read next.﻿Read moreShow less The new AdWords UI uses Dart — we asked why news.dartlang.org Google just announced a re-designed AdWords experience.

We shared details on Ice Cream Sandwich, our next version of +Android and the first that worked everywhere, regardless of device. We added Movies to Android Market (which later became +Google Play). We also demoed Music Beta, a new personal music streaming service. We’ve been dancing at Google I/O ever since! The I/O Bootcamp of the previous year was so popular we decided to incorporate it into the conference itself as Code Labs in 2011, and they’re still part of I/O today. Watch the keynote videos for more: Day 1 (https://youtu.be/OxzucwjFEEs) and Day 2 (https://youtu.be/MiYND_zvIc0)! That year we created our very first I/O Chrome Experiment (https://goo.gl/MXzvZt): A countdown towards the start of Google I/O using canvas and three.js. The countdown lived on the conference website and got some extra love on Valentine’s Day! It also made it on stage as the colorful keynote kick-off.
