SSL Search - Search Help
#Content#
Search Help Search Help Search Help forumForum SSL Search Searching over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) gives you a more secure and private search experience. Turn SSL on or off SSL isn't a setting that you need to change. As long as you're searching on https://www.google.com (note the "s" in "https," meaning "secure"), you're using SSL search. If you don't want to use SSL search, use the "http" version of the web address instead. How SSL helps protect your data SSL encrypts the connection between your computer and Google. This helps prevent others, like Internet cafes, Internet Service Providers, and Wi-Fi hotspots, from seeing your search results page and login information. Limitations While SSL helps protect your search results, which may include personal results from Google products like Gmail and Google Calendar, it doesn't provide complete security. SSL doesn't always hide: The fact that you visited google.com The search terms you typed For example, when you visit another website from the Google search results page, that website may be able to identify what site you came from or the search terms that you used. SSL and schools If you are a school or organization where SSL interferes with parental controls, monitoring programs, or auditing software, learn more about blocking adult content at your school.
