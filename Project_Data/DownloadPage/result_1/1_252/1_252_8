Many of UCAR’s programs are dedicated to delivering data to end users, from scientists to university faculty. As a leader in the data community, UCAR works toward common data and metadata standards, as well as archiving and dissemination platforms, that can extend data utility to stakeholders. What does UCAR Offer? Unidata coordinates the Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system in which hundreds of universities cooperate to disseminate near real-time earth observations via the Internet. Unidata’s Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) is a 3D geoscience visualization and analysis tool that gives users the ability to view and analyze a rich set of geoscience data in an integrated fashion. The IDV brings together the ability to display and analyze satellite imagery, gridded data, surface observations, RADAR, and other types of data within a unified interface. Unidata also distributes and supports the GEMPAK and McIDAS visualization packages, and is working to make the National Weather Service’s AWIPS II package available to the university community. Through the COSMIC program, we have provided more than 4.1 million radio occultation soundings to the science and weather forecasting communities. All global operational centers are making use of COSMIC data, which has demonstrated significant positive impacts on their forecasts. DLS and NSDL have pioneered the use of metadata and archiving to create digital libraries of education materials. We are now applying that experience to scientific data sets to increase their utility and inter-compatability.
