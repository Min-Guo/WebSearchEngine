Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS has just announced the theme for the 2016 show, happening June 19 at New York’s Hammerstein Ballroom: “Broadway Bares: On Demand” promises to offer everything we love about television—without those pesky censors!     BC/EFA slipped us some racy preview images to give you a clearer picture. Launched back in 1992 by Tony-winning director/choreographer Jerry Mitchell (On Your Feet!, Kinky Boots), Broadway cares features sizzling dance numbers and appearances by A-list celebrities. It’s always a surprise to see who “pops” up, but in past years, James Franco, Laverne Cox, Vanessa Williams, Fran Drescher and even Bianca Del Rio have all got in on the fun. The 20 Most Inventive Strips From 'Broadway Bares: Rock Hard' And this is no chump-change affair: To date, the 25 editions of Broadway Bares have raised more than $14.3 million for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.
