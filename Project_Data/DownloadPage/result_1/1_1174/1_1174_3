Want to know how to use it for marketing? To discover how to create a content strategy on Snapchat, I interview Carlos Gil. More About This Show The Social Media Marketing podcast is an on-demand talk radio show from Social Media Examiner. It’s designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing. In this episode I interview Carlos Gil, the head of social media marketing at BMC Software and co-host of the Social 545 podcast. He’s also an avid Snapchat user. Carlos will explore Snapchat, and specifically, how marketers can benefit from it. You’ll discover why Snapchat isn’t just for Millennials. Listen as Carlos Gil shares what marketers need to know about winning with Snapchat content strategy. Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.

Here are some of the things you’ll discover in this show: Snapchat Content Strategy How Carlos got started on Snapchat In 2013, Carlos had been working in social media for about eight years and was leading social media for a supermarket chain, when a teenager told him Facebook was essentially for older people. He decided as a marketer, he needed to get on Snapchat, because the Millennials who were using it would soon be adults. He says he spent most of 2014 getting to know the platform and creating content. Over the course of a solid year, Snapchat became his go-to social network. Carlos Gil started exploring Snapchat around Thanksgiving 2013. Carlos began seeing more of his friends within the social media marketing community on the platform. What sold him on Snapchat over other networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, was the engagement. Snapchat essentially forces your audience to come back and watch your content within a 24-hour period, because if they don’t see it, it goes away. Listen to the show to learn about Snapchat’s previous reputation. Why marketers and entrepreneurs should be on Snapchat Last February, we had Gary Vaynerchuk and Shaun McBride (aka Shonduras) on the podcast to discuss Snapchat. A year later, it looks like Snapchat is about to explode. Snapchat has more than 200 million monthly active users and its audience continues to grow and mature. Snapchat is very transparent when it comes to their demographics, and reports that 77% of their user base is above the age of 18. Snapchat is now the primary place where Carlos shares his content. Carlos thinks people are consuming so much content on Snapchat because it puts what you love about Twitter (the micro-content aspect) and what you love about YouTube (pressing a Play button to sit back and watch content) into a single app. You can go in and press a button to see what anyone you’re following has done in the last day. He explains that when you publish content on Snapchat, it’s available for 24 hours, which forces your network to come back and watch it. The messaging feature on Snapchat, which works almost like a text message, allows you to send content directly to your friends. Then, you can specify how long you want that content to be seen, and see when someone views your content . Listen to the show to discover why Snapchat is amazing at getting their users’ attention. Types of Snapchat content Carlos shares that there are two different kinds of snaps: one is a photo and the other is a video of up to 10 seconds. For images, he says there are a couple of different filters you can use to change the contrast and color of your photo. There are also geofilters, which are graphic overlays for your photos, based on your location. For example there are geofilters exclusive to cities and other locations such as Disneyland. Geofilters are exclusive to locations. Videos have the same geofilters, but also have features like fast-forward, rewind, and slow motion. There are a couple of additional tricks to spruce up your snaps so they look better than average video content on your smartphone. Listen to the show to hear what else you can add to your Snapchat photos. Snapchat Content Strategy Carlos uses Snapchat primarily for the daily story component through video in which he shares his day. Some days are more exciting than others, he admits, but he uses these videos to engage his social media audience. He says he also uses the text overlay feature a lot. When he creates a new video on YouTube, a new podcast episode, or a new blog post, he’ll share a snap of it with a text overlay asking his audience to visit the content or give their feedback on it. Carlos shares other content like his podcast episodes on Snapchat. He explains that because you have to create content within the app (you can’t upload a video or a nicely designed image), the content on Snapchat gives viewers an authentic, raw view of whoever is creating it. Carlos says that being able see who’s viewed his content puts Snapchat above the other networks for him. He’ll look at who has seen his story throughout the day and send them a message. He shares that saying “thank you,” whether it’s video or text, makes a big difference. Doing that over time, Carlos says, will build your community. Listen to the show to learn about Snapchat stories. How people are using Snapchat Carlos says Gary Vaynerchuk definitely sets the bar for anyone looking to use Snapchat for personal branding. Gary leverages his popularity on Twitter and Facebook to get his followers to follow him on Snapchat where he does a great job of connecting with his audience. Gary invites people on his other social networks to follow him on Snapchat. Gary takes time to engage with his community on Snapchat and shares organic, native content they won’t find anywhere else. He’ll ask a question, encourage his community to write to him, and he’ll write them back. He uses Snapchat to promote his Ask Gary Vee show with snaps like, “I’ve just posted a video on YouTube. Go check it out.” Another example is Shaun Ayala, an artist who creates some cool images. Shaun asked Carlos, who is a big Simpsons fan, to take a selfie and snap it to him. Within five minutes Shaun sent Carlos that same selfie with Bart Simpson in the photo. When Star Wars came out, Shaun drew clips from the trailer to Star Wars and put them on Snapchat. Artist Shaun Ayala draws incredible overlays onto his snaps. Carlos says that while there are use cases for using Snapchat for business, it definitely weighs heavier on the personal branding side. At its core, Snapchat is for storytellers, Carlos explains. You learn how to speak 10 seconds at a time. There’s so much value. What’s worthwhile is not only seeing the numbers of viewers, but having people who enjoy your content reach out and ask where they can learn more about you. Listen to the show to discover how Mike is using Snapchat. How to discover people and get discovered Carlos says the easiest way to get discovered by others on Snapchat is to open the app and tap on the ghost icon. Then tap the top right corner of the icon to save and share your Snapchat code. To help people discover and be discovered, Carlos created the Snapchat Directory. He explains that users can add their own name to the directory and download other Snapchat users’ handles. He shares that Snapchat Codes is another place to find users to follow. Add your Snapchat name to Carlos’ Snapchat Directory. And if you click on Add Friends, Snapchat will crawl the address book on your smartphone. Anyone in your phone’s directory who has registered their phone number with a Snapchat account will show up. Listen to the show to hear what Carlos thinks about Snapchat shoutouts.

Carlos is definitely one to follow. I also love the fact that Snapchat is different than the others social sites in so many way. It’s refreshing because it forces us to create content that is different, get on and try it out! Thanks SME for including me. I appreciate it 😀 Michael A. Stelzner Thanks Shaun! Austin Iuliano I have seen the highest level of organic engagement on snapchat. There is massive attention in this platform and everyone should focus their efforts there. Carlos does a great job in Snapchat stories. Eileen Doyon very informative! Michael A. Stelzner Yea Austin it is pretty amazing huh Michael A. Stelzner Thanks Eileen Gwenaelle DIALLO I actually think Snapchat looks a lot like Periscope, especially with the idea of intimacy and immediacy they both convey. Snapchat is definitely revolutionary; it can be used as a powerful tool for brands to humanize their brand by showing the “behind-the-scenes” of their products’ creation process for example. If it’s visually appealing, it’s a nice way to share what’s happening in your business! However I think that in order for Snapchat to be effective for a brand, its target should be 35 and younger. Snapchat is the key to reach out these demographics and represents a great opportunity: it is worth a serious look! Thanks for sharing, great article! Gwenaelle DIALLO Graduation May, 2018 Freeman School of Business / Tulane University ESSEC Business School Aria Fanavari Good. Thanks Melody Hey. I love your podcasts. But where can i download the scripts of the listening materials? Thank you. Michael A. Stelzner Hey Meoldy, there are no scripts, just the post you see here Michael A. Stelzner Thanks for your comments. I see that demographic expanding a lot. hamzadaoui To me here is why people use snapchat. The goal will all these social media platforms is that people wanted to be “social”. They wanted to connect. They wanted be “humans online”. We tried to do that with twitter, facebook and instagram. But people started cheating. They only show what they want, how they want it. The way they want it. We even started creating these alter-egos on social media. Snapchat to an extend is realest thing out there right now. And that’s fun. Also the fact your content is deleted the next day is important. Because people can’t really use the content you share against you. I’m talking about your future girlfriend or future boss. Snapchat is just a little taste on how we will share content in the future. But again that’s just how I personally feel. Cheers. JessicaJLeighton your site with effective and useful information. It is included very nice post with a lot of our resources. thanks for share. and i give lot of knowledge in your site. ever things best your site.
