He snapped out of his funk at just the right time Monday night in Brooklyn. Olynyk scored seven straight points for the Celtics from the 9:29 mark to the 8:19 mark of the fourth, providing the Celtics with a 16-point lead over their hosts. The first bucket of the run came via a flush after Olynyk caught a pretty dish from teammate Evan Turner. The big man then canned a 3 pointer and followed that up with a tip-in basket to take the score to 96-80. That 16-point lead stood as the largest of the game. Boston controlled the final eight minutes of the night, never allowing the Nets to slice the lead to fewer than nine points. Olynyk’s personal spurt brought his point total to 18, which was his final tally on the night. He can take solace in the fact that he snapped out of his slump just in time to propel the C’s to a 110-91 win. Key Player There will be much more content on Celtics.com regarding Evan Turner and his triple-double, but that doesn’t mean we could skip out on calling him the Key Player of the Game. Turner was fantastic from start to finish, notching the second triple-double both of his season and career. He tallied 19 points on the game, falling one point short of Avery Bradley’s total for the team high. He also dished out a game-high 12 assists to go along with a game-high 10 boards. Here’s how much better Turner was than nearly every other teammate: his 12 assists were at least eight more than every other Celtic, and his 10 boards were at least three more than every other Celtic. Oh, and did we mention that he did all of this while committing only two turnovers? As you might imagine, Brad Stevens chose to leave Turner on the floor for most of the night. He logged 40-plus minutes of playing time and Boston outscored Brooklyn by 19 points during those minutes. Box Score Nuggets Six Celtics scored in double-figures, led by 20 points from Avery Bradley. Both teams grabbed at least 47 rebounds but Even Turner was the only player to notch a double-digit rebound total. He grabbed 10 boards. Turner notched a triple-double with 19 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds. Brook Lopez scored a game-high 31 points. Neither team committed more than 12 turnovers. Brooklyn made 12 more free throws (26) than Boston attempted (14). Kelly Olynyk scored 18 points off the bench for Boston. The Celtics scored at least 27 points in each of the final three quarters. Both teams scored at least 56 points in the paint. There was only one lead change in the game. Deron Williams dished out 10 assists for Brooklyn. Four Celtics blocked a shot, but none of them blocked more than one. Tyler Zeller scored 18 points on 9-of-13 shooting. Brooklyn shot 26-of-30 from the free-throw line. The Celtics limited the Nets to just 1-of-17 shooting from long range, good for 5.9 percent. Quote of the Night I heard a guy in the crowd tell Zeller, 'Don't touch the ball and give Evan another rebound.' Evan Turner on if he knew he was bordering on a triple-double during the fourth quarter.
