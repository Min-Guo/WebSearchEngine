This time it plays no sound every time I plug it into my car to listen while I drive. I hate having to keep this app on my phone when it's easily the worst functioning app I have but I have no other alternative. Hire more staff or de-bug your versions before you release more terrible updates. Save your car battery!       by SansCheetah If your local am station shutoff, you listen to your national program here. Great on-the-go! Can set-up auto play to remind you/tune in at a specific time. Would be improved if could schedule at different times + more stations Needs a lot of work       by Tony 45434 This app is terrible. Constantly cuts out on me when trying to listen to a live show. It will also try to buffer and cut ahead in my show after falling behind, causing me to miss parts of the show. It also has the habit of just playing a commercial whenever it wants, again, in the middle of a live show. This app needs serious work Customers Also Bought Amazon Music with Prime Music Music View In iTunes Live Nation At The Concert – Tickets & Presale Access for Upcoming Concerts & Live Music Events Music View In iTunes Simple Radio - Music, News, Talk & Sports stations Music View In iTunes iHeartRadio – Free Music & Radio Stations Music View In iTunes TouchTunes Music View In iTunes View In iTunes This app is designed for both iPhone and iPad Offers Apple Watch App for iPhone Free Category: Music Updated: Mar 17, 2016 Version: 4.4.2 Size: 41.1 MB Apple Watch: Yes Language: English Seller: CBS Local TM & © 2015 CBS Local Digital Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.
