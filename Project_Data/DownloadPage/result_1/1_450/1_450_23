So I'm a lesbian and my older sister is always saying that I'm not really a lesbian, I just "haven't found the right man yet." Why do you think she says that? Anonymous misandry-mermaid: Ask her if she’s sexually attracted to llamas, and if she says she isn’t, tell her she just hasn’t found the right llama yet.  He’s out there, waiting.  Then bombard her with llama photos and tell her not to be such a fucking bigot.

Source: stand-up-comic-gifs Many children of toxic parents find it exceptionally difficult to identify who they are once they grow up. Susan Forward identifies three areas in which their self-knowledge falls short: “who you are, what you feel, and what you want.” You’ve spent so much time suppressing your real self, from your emotions to your reactions, to deal with the onslaught of your parents that you haven’t had a chance to pay attention to your own development. Your sense of confusion and distance runs very deep indeed. “ — 7 Signs You Grew Up With A Toxic Parent & Didn’t Know It (via reina-rubia) Reblogged 4 hours ago from misscherrylikesthediscourse (Originally from reina-rubia) 1,865 notes Tagged: identity, toxic parents, toxic relationships, child abuse, child development, . Source: reina-rubia “I’m pro-choice, but….” misandry-mermaid: There is no “but” after “I’m pro choice.“  You cannot be conditionally pro-choice.  No matter the pregnant person’s age, lifestyle, how they got pregnant, how many abortions they’ve already had, whether or not you would get an abortion, it is irrelevant.  Either you 100% support a pregnant person’s right to make their own reproductive decisions, or you’re NOT pro-choice.

Study Shows That Pay Drops Universally in Male-Dominated Fields When Women Join En Masse » When we talk about things like the wage gap, we often believe that if only this gap were closed, that would solve a good chunk of women’s problems in the workplace. Unfortunately, just because the gap is closed between men and women doesn’t mean that women will be paid more than they are now. A recent study done by NYU, UPenn, and the University of Haifa in Israel determined that whenever a bunch of women start getting into a male-dominated field in large numbers, pay in that field decreases across the board. Apparently, because if women can do that job, it must not be that hard, or that important, or something.

Source: pseudo-comfort real talk: y’all can unfollow us if you agree with Erykah Badu. ankh-niggas-anonymous: 3am-east: futureblackpolitician: ankh-niggas-anonymous: there is absolutely nothing okay with victim blaming or justifying sexual assault because “we are all sexual beings” first of all: no we’re not. not every one of us are sexual beings. some of us are highly sex-repulsed or just asexual and want nothing to do with the idea of sex. so get that shit out of your mind. second of all: no its not fucking normal to be attracted to young girls in short skirts. its not “being human”. what the fuck does that even mean. the idea of what is normal for a human being is purely a sociological construct that goes goes hand in hand with culture and historical context. there were entire societies with women being bare chested and no one fucking blinked an eye. hell, there are still entire societies that dont even think of breasts as a sexual part of a woman’s body. y’all need to stop thinking “its in our nature to think young girls are attractive” do y’all even hear yourselves when you say it outloud or do you just fucking type that in and click enter because it looks right third: unfollow us if you agree w/ her, we don’t tolerate pedophilia here.  Facts. Ditto to all of this. Unfollow me for real I agree with Erykah Badu so add me to the list of people you need to unfollow as well as share content with because Yall are dumb as hell.
