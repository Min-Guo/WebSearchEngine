Urban Cowboy is more than just a film, it’s a document of the moment our culture tilted towards the south. Overnight, country music found itself in vogue for the first time in history. At the epicenter of it all was Gilley’s, a nightclub located just outside Houston in the oilfields of Pasadena, Texas. The story of this great big Honky Tonk -- of its boom and bust -- became a microcosm of the city and the music it came to represent. This is that story -- about a blockbuster -- about a bar -- and about a nation that finally went country.
