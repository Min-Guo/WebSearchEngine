Jacquie Lee About Jacquie Lee Every now and then a young artist comes along that can turn heads with effortless powerhouse vocals, and silence a crowd with tender performances. 17-year old Atlantic Records/300 Entertainment artist and songwriter Jacquie Lee is just that. Armed with a piano and pen, Jacquie delivers confessional and heartfelt tales of life and love that hit home with anyone that has felt the highs and lows of growing up and finding their way. A New Jersey native, she began singing at the age of seven. A shy girl, she would sing behind a closed door to her parents listening on the other side. It was not until she won the lead role in her 5th grade play Mulan that she began performing to crowds, realizing that she felt most at home on stage. Over the next several years, she would perform with Rockit, a program run out of the Count Basie Theatre in Red Bank, NJ, where talented musicians come together to form rock bands and perform together live in concert. She continued to follow her passion, adding songwriting to her resume and began singing at local charitable events that became close to her heart. At the age of 15, Jacquie won over America on Season 5 of the top-rated NBC show The Voice. Under the mentorship of Christina Aguilera, Jacquie's impressive showing as first runner up to a seasoned professional signals the amazing talent that lies within this young artist. Now with the experience of The Voice under her belt and a steadfast commitment to furthering her journey in music, she remains focused on her artistry and on continuing to share her astounding voice and music with her fans. She recently signed with Atlantic Records in joint partnership with 300 Entertainment. Her debut single “Broken Ones,” a stirring anthem about accepting and loving the flaws in one another, is out now and shot to the Top 20 on the iTunes Pop Chart upon release. It is approaching 7 million streams on Spotify and became one of the most requested songs on Radio Disney within days of going into rotation on the channel. She will perform “Broken Ones” on NBC’s Today Show in October 2014 and returned to The Voice stage in May 2014 to perform the track. Elle will feature Jacquie in the November 2014 issue and she has recently received praise from Glamour, Teen Vogue, Seventeen and more. Earlier this year, as part of her ongoing commitment to give back to her home state that has given her so much, Jacquie headlined Operation Provide Comfort’s “Two Towns-One Voice-One Mission” concert to benefit the ongoing relief effort for the residents of Union Beach, NJ affected by Hurricane Sandy. On October 21, 2014, Jacquie will release her debut EP Broken Ones. From the upbeat soulful pop tracks of “Tears Fall” and “Drown Me (In Your Love),” to the beautiful, soul-baring ballad “Right Love,” Broken Ones is a dynamic and authentic debut full of honest lyrics and nuanced vocals that stay with you long after the last note plays. Jacquie’s darker, tender take on the classic “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” is a unique, statement-making track that closes the EP, further underscoring her undeniable artistry and solidifying her as one of the most exciting and promising talents in music today. As the next chapter of her career is quickly unfolding all eyes are on Jacquie, eagerly anticipating what this rising star has in store for us next.
