I have had 11 emails and finally got the password I am supposed to use. I get the new addition and try to log on and of course it will not let me on. I even cut and paste directly from there email after typing in 6 times. It is obvious they outsourced this. How hard is it to log in - I have never had this problem in years of working with the iPad.
