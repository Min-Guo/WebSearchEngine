Elizabeth Bennett (Jennifer Ehle) is one of five sisters living on a British country estate in the 1800s. At a time and place in which matrimony is considered a woman's logical goal in life, Elizabeth displays a cautious reluctance toward marriage -- so when a wealthy young man, Fitzwilliam Darcy (Colin Firth) expresses an interest in courting her, she isn't so sure she cares for him. Elizabeth and Darcy discover that they have a great deal to learn about each other -- and no small amount to overcome in their minds -- if they are to find happiness together. Pride and Prejudice was produced as a five hour mini-series by the BBC and was first shown in the U.S. on the A&E cable network. Advertising Editorial Reviews Barnes & Noble - Amy Robinson Transforming Jane Austen's intricate, subtly satiric novels into suitable screen fare is not an easy accomplishment, but this five-hour BBC version of her most-loved work makes the transition from page to screen brilliantly. The courtship rituals between the daughters of a country gentleman and their widely varied suitors are hampered by excesses of both pride and prejudice; most particularly, the courtship of the snobbish but eminently wealthy Darcy (Colin Firth) and the delightfully independent Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle). Ehle perfectly captures Elizabeth's lively sense of humor and keen intelligence, while Firth persuasively portrays a man whose surface reserve masks violent emotions. While the essential plot has elements of soap-opera cliché, Pride and Prejudice is anything but. Its clear-eyed observations of human frailty and folly and its straightforward romanticism make this impressively mounted miniseries a touching, comedic and naturalistic melodrama, satisfying to both longtime fans and Austen novices. All Movie Guide - Mike Cummings Thanks to this made-for-TV film and three other film adaptations of Jane Austen's novels -- Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility, and Clueless (based on Emma) -- the work of Jane Austen enjoyed a renaissance in bookstores and college classrooms in 1995. Pride and Prejudice has several things going for it. First, the actors perform brilliantly, bringing Georgian England to life with their class-conscious behavior and attitudes and their drawing-room repartee. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are particularly good as the central characters, Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. Second, writer Andrew Davies' script wisely includes verbatim dialogue from the Austen novel that is rich in wit, irony, and humor. Third, producer Sue Birtwistle pays close attention to period costumes, customs, and surroundings. Even the dances mimic authentic gambols and frolics popular in Austen's times. Fourth, the length of the film enables director Simon Langton to present a complete -- or nearly complete -- exposition of the plot. Consequently, viewers are treated to many entertaining scenes, involving minor as well as major characters, that probably would have been omitted in a shorter film version of the novel. Although the highly praised 1940 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, had much to commend it, its length forced it to truncate the plot and present an abridged ghost of the real story. Fans of Olivier and Garson may balk at assertions that Langton's 1995 adaptation has become the definitive film version of the novel, but the popularity of the Langton version and the reviews of many critics suggest that it has.

My recent purchase was a gift. Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors. I've read all of her books multiple times and have seen every movie adaptation of her books. In my opinion, this is the absolute best primarily due to the casting and the screenplay. I've seen very few of the cast in other movies. However, even though they are not as well known as the cast in the most recent version of P&P, they are almost all superior in their roles. When I reread the book now, the voices I hear in my head for Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennett, and many of the other characters are those from this movie. And I can't even begin to describe how perfect Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehrle are. Most of Darcy's feelings and attitudes have to be conveyed via facial expressions and body language rather than with dialogue, and Firth is superlative at doing so. Keira Knightly may look more like she's 20 than Ehrle does, but Ehrle's portrayal does a far better job of capturing Elizabeth's character and spirit. The two problems I have with most adaptations is that they cut out significant portions of the book in order to fit within the time limits of a movie and/or they make unnecessary changes that cause the movie to be very different than than the original book. Since this was a miniseries, the time restriction wasn't an issue. While not word for word the same, this is a faithful adaptation of the spirit of the book. The changes that were made seem to be those that were necessary to best tell the story cinematically. I'd give this DVD 10 stars if I could. Orla More than 1 year ago This version of PRIDE & PREJUDICE is exactly like the book. Even down to certain conversations between characters. Colin Firth puts in a wonderful performance as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle plays Elizabeth Bennet splendidly. donnawillow More than 1 year ago I am a 49 yr old woman who grew up listening to Led Zeppelin and drag racing in my brothers 1969 Dodge Charger Hemi. I am a mother of four grown children and I never heard of Jane Austin untill my 17 yr old daughter introduced me to her excellent works. I saw the BBC Movie and instantly fell in love with Darcy (Colin Firth) and Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle). I have the the two DVD collection and I've about worn it out! Sometimes if I have alot going on like paying bills I will put the movie on in the background, it's like comfort food.Years later and I still can't get enough of it, it's Amazing If you have not seen this movie you are in for a wild ride. I only watch the A&amp;E version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. not the cheesy Kiera Nightly version. Donna Romatowski Soozabella More than 1 year ago This is truly exquisite and I watch it over and over. Jennifer Ehle is my favorite Elizabeth Bennett and Colin Firth truly was born to this role. David Bamber brilliantly makes my skin crawl, as he did as Marcus Tullius Cicero. I watch it sometimes just to hear the Mozart scene in the Pemberton music room. The direction, screenplay, and cinematography are beautiful. A&E DVDs, however, are maddeningly poor quality, which is such an insult to the art direction and cinematography of their productions). Tortuously, to me, you can't always know if you'll get captions or not. Some are not labeled anywhere as CC or subtitled but, somwhow, there ARE closed captions. This happened to me with several other DVDs. The wretched down side is, of course, when you take a chance on an unlabeled DVD and there ARE NO captions. Aiyee, it has happened several times - most maddeningly with "Reilly, Ace of Spies." As a deaf film aficianado, I must have captions or English subtitles and I am so grateful they were mysteriously THERE in this most outstanding Austen production. Guest More than 1 year ago Everytime I read a book I never want to see the movie because it always seems to ruin the book. I can tell you that this isn't the case with Pride and Prejudice. The movie is quite long but you get so involved in it that it's over way too soon. The movie is exactly like the book...for those of you that liked Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice, you will love the movie. And to all of you who couldn't get into the book or didn't understand it I doubly reccomend seeing the movie and then rereading the book. It will truely come alive for you. This is my ultimate all-time favorite movie. If I had to recommend a movie to buy, this would be it. Guest More than 1 year ago My second attempt to get a quality DVD version of Jennifer Ehle & Colin Firth¿s portrayal of Lizzy and Darcy, has failed. My first attempt was almost a year ago when the latest release came out in August. It¿s disappointing to report that the DVD version of ¿Pride and Prejudice¿ ,the Special Edition (ISBN 0-7670-3826-6) distributed by NEWVIDEO for B.B.C. and A&E (cat.# AAE-70254) suffers from remarkably poor quality control. It¿s contrast is too severe. Details of ruffles and folds of costumes are lost to the viewer. Hair style details are likewise lost or disappear in the darkness of shrubbery backgrounds and foliage. Actors all appear pale unto death, and buildings exposed to too much ultraviolet rays. Patterns in dresses, waistcoat, or draperies are 90% lost. Colours are devoid of hue as found in the VHS tapes. I spot checked several Chapters on the DVD and was demoralized. I then ran the DVD and the VHS versions simultaneously on split screen. The DVD version is drab/¿washed-out¿ by comparison. There are times when the images are not in focus. And the VHS version is, even at it¿s worst - where there is signal deteriation, still more vivid than the DVD version. Sadly too, I know that the VHS version will continue to deteriorate, and fear that future copies of video will be made from the current flawed DVDs. Tell anyone that you can and have them complain to A & E, B.B.C and New Video (they all have websites) that the current DVDs are of shameful quality. Guest More than 1 year ago This is by far the best adaptation of any Jane Austen novel. Colin Firth became a much sought after leading man (for good reason) following this movie and Jennifer Ehle brings Elizabeth Bennett to life. All of the supporting characters are brilliantly played, particularly Lizzy's parents and sisters. Mr. Collins is every bit as toadish as he appears in the book and I honestly thought that Lady Catherine de Bourgh had come to life out of a painting - she is quite intimidating! Unfortunatly, the VHS copy is far superior to this poor copy on DVD. I couldn't figure out why it didn't hold up to what I remember viewing on television until I played the two side-by-side. Considering how much care was put into making the P&P production, it is amazing the DVD is so washed out and colorless. They only reason to buy this edition rather than tapes is if you do not have a VCR. Guest More than 1 year ago I first saw this movie on A&E and I just had to have it. Pride and Prejudice is my all time favorite fiction move. I first bought it on VHS and then when DVD came out I bought that also. I have let several people watch the picture. In my opinion the stars who played the main characters of Darcy and Elizabeth couldn't be beat. Colin Firth is Mr. Darcy as Jennifer Ehle is Elizabeth. I have watched the movie several times and read the book even more. I also especially enjoyed the lady who played the mother of Elizabeth. In my opinion she also could not be beat. I even felt embarrassed for her. I think this is the mark of a really good actor/actress when they can get the audience involved in a movie. thornn More than 1 year ago A classic. This is my favorite version. Still it is just one version. I collect and appreciate every version on it's own. i have the 1940 version, the 1985? version this version.. and the version starring Keirra Knightly. This was my hands down favorite drama until i discovered Korean Drama. No one has made a drama like the South Koreans have. I loved that this drama had 2 versions which were mini series.. 5 or six hours in length. well the koreans have drama's 80+ hours in length.. just as good as this one.. I lost sleep and skipped meals because i could not stop. You will begin to understand the term watch till you drop. then get up and watch some more. Still i look back on P&amp;P with fondness .. i will watch it again. ALthough the actors are different. .the story is the same.. I enjoy watching it from different perspectives. The J. Ehle version is my favorite tho. SiouxBee More than 1 year ago I accidently discovered an answer to the (justified) criticism of the dvd quality. Due to the fact this is my favorite dvd in my collection, when I got a Blu-ray player for Christmas, it was the first thing I popped in. The my amazement and delight there was suddenly color, texture, pattern and the washed out appearance is no longer a problem. Try this solution and see if you agree. However I am still getting the Blu-ray version! MegKMK More than 1 year ago I love this version of Pride &amp; Prejudice and I have watched it many times. The selection of the cast was excellent from Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle to all the supporting cast. The scenery and the music was very well done and made the movie even more enjoyable. If you are going to purchase Pride &amp; Prejudice on DVD this the one to buy. There are several other versions made over the years but this movie made in 1995 is by far the best. I hope you love it as much as I have. Anonymous More than 1 year ago This was the best film adaptation of the novel. Colin Firth was the perfect Darcey &amp; Jennifer Ehle was wonderful as were most of the other characters. I also enjoyed the Greer Garson version eventhough she was too old to play Elizabeth &amp; they lightened the mood of most of the characters. I liked the movie made a few years ago but the actor playing Darcey couldn't hold a candle to the Firth performance. I recently reread the original novel and I now mentally visualize the characters using the characters from this BBC adaptation. Anonymous More than 1 year ago I've own three versions of this movie and this is definetly the best. My only reservations (and a 4 rather than 5 rating) are due to editing and a few casting choices. I think the film would have been better without some unnecessary scenes (eg landscape). The actress who played Jane is not the beauty decribed in the book, and the actor playing Wickham was not very appealing. I couldn't believe Elizabeth liking him. Other than that, it is a movie I have watched and enjoyed many times. Clicquet More than 1 year ago A while ago,We purchased this Lovely adaptation from Miss.Jane Austen's Immense Tomes.Viewed Earliest version on PBS. Was a veritable, fall over Laugh of a Drama/Comedic Moments Treat.This is a Solemn,Thoughtfull Variation. There really Is the Question that Begs,Whom is Full of Pride? Whom is Prejudice? Truly left to the Viewer.I have my own thoughts,However not to Be Missed to Keep!We paid so much more than this Delicious Offer.Miss.Bennett and Mr.Darcy are as Star Crossed as can be. Performances are all Fabulous.Loathing those that One will eventually.Adore the Moments when a tear trickles down the cheek,for a quick grab for tissues.The Best of British filming. sproutingsherbet More than 1 year ago I've seen many adaptations of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice pur to film, and this is by far the best version ever created. Colin Firth is perfect as the respectably awkward and quietly upstanding citizen Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle plays Ms. Bennet with a fiery passion in her eyes and an adventurousness in spirit. Hollywood may have done their own version, but this is the version you'll want to curl up on the couch and watch again and again. Anonymous More than 1 year ago This is the best movie adaption of a book I've ever seen. The plot is very true to the book. The characters are portrayed brilliantly and the set and costume design are wonderful. I recently watched the Keira Knightly version. I would have liked it, but it paled in comparison. So, if you watched that version and liked it, be prepared to love this one. SuziSnowflake More than 1 year ago I have seen all the versions of this. I keep going back to this one. It is by far the best. Guest More than 1 year ago This movie is one of the best movies I saw. I borrowed the VHS tapes from a friend of mine two weeks ago. I saw it twice within these two weeks. I really enjoyed it. Yesterday I received the DVD, which I ordered. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT! The quality of this DVD is the worst I have seen and by far from any other DVD I saw. Hard to believe but the picture quality of the tapes is much better than the DVD itself! The DVD lacks any additional materials, subtitle, etc. I highly recommend seeing the movie, but buy the tapes instead. Guest More than 1 year ago BBS was able to transform this most fascinating work of Jane Austen into an elegant and entertaining piece of art. This is the best adoptation of Pride and Prejudice I have ever seen, and I think it would take a lot of effort for someone else to outdo this production. The acting is excellent and the directing is carefully, and beautifully, done. I recommend this highly!!! Guest More than 1 year ago I just rented this movie last week; I loved it so much that I just bought the DVD to add to my movie collection. The movie is true to the book. The lead actors do such a wonderful job, and the story moves along quite nicely. Now I understand why this mini-series took the public by storm when it was first released. Guest More than 1 year ago Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book so I was naturally leary when I saw this movie on A&E a few years ago. Needless to say, I was amazed to see the book come alive for me. Colin Firth and Jane Ehle bring new meaning to the words pride and prejudice in their roles as Darcy and Elizabeth (you could cut the sexual tension between them with a knife.) Girls, keep your eyes open for the pond scene where Darcy takes a dip - it isn't just Bridget Jones' favorite scene it is also mine.) The costumes and location shots are great also. I highly recommend adding this movie to your collection to watch over and over. Now, if I could only get my boyfriend to sit for 5 hours with me - I would be a happy girl. Guest More than 1 year ago I just want to take this oportunity to let you all in on the greatest movie adaptation of a book ever produced. Nothing is cut out yet you are glued to the screen the whole time, without even two minutes of boring footage or story line. Plus you get to stare at Colin Firth for 5 hours, what could be better. If you have ever read Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice you need to see this movie, it is so well done, and the scenery, costumes and script are all so wonderful, great for a rainy day. Guest More than 1 year ago No matter what mood you are in, this masterpiece will always get you on the right track again with its' witty, cleaver, romantic, and absolutely enchanting dialogue and story. The casting couldn't have been made better, and the filmings of the English countryside is a real eye-pleaser. Jennifer Ehle is perfect in her role as miss Bennet, and as for Colin Firth I have three words: Oh my God. His portrayal of mr Darcy may be one of the sexiest and most interesting interpretation of a male character on screen ever made. I don't know any woman (or man) who hasn't sufferd from a crush on mr Darcy after having seen him in action. This is the perfect thing to watch when at home, sick or simply have a few hours to spare!
