The growth of cities in emerging markets is driving the most significant economic transformation in history.

Urban World can help, by presenting an interactive economic and demographic map of the evolving urban landscape. • Spin the globe, and pinch to zoom in on individual countries and cities and compare their population, household incomes, or GDP side-by-side. • Use the search function to move quickly to a specific city, country, or region. • Explore GDP from 1 CE to 2025 and view the shift in the world’s economic center of gravity over that same time period.
