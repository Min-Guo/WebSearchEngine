JOHN MAYER Twitter Instagram YouTube Archive Random RSS Huh. Why am I not on Tumblr anymore? Just looked around, and I gotta tell ya… it holds up! Miss this place.  7 months ago / 1,286 notes (Source: chuckhistory, via chuckhistory) 1 year ago / 63,850 notes 1 year ago / 2,692 notes Hiroki Nakamura  #visvim 1 year ago / 3,131 notes Osamu Nagahama  1 year ago / 516 notes loans,investments,savings 1 year ago / 1,200 notes John Mayer/Steve Jordan/Pino Palladino/Chick Corea/Wallace Roney Here’s a full seven minute tune I loosely composed called “Little Sur,” recorded last February in New York City. I got together with some of my friends and favorite players for six amazing days of playing music with no rules, no plans, and no pressure. Oh, and no vocals. What came from it was a really inspired batch of recordings. Hours of music that I’ll need to sift through at some point should it ever become an album. (I hope it does.) If you’re wondering where I am in the mix, that’s me playing a Music Man long scale guitar… Pino and I are kind of both living in the bass space. As soon as Chick came in on the piano, I knew something really deep was taking place.  This is the rough mix that was given to me at the end of the day, as it has lived on my laptop since. I tried to find a minute, two minute clip to share with you, but these recordings just don’t work any other way than in their unabridged form. So here it is. Free music. Played freely, shared freely. Put it on and go for the ride… If you dig all seven minutes, then surely you deserve them.  There are times for marketing strategies, and there are times for just  p l a y i n g. The original design for all musicians.  Hope you enjoy hearing this as much as I did.  John  #SoundCloud #jhnmyr #John Mayer 2 years ago / 3,057 notes 2 years ago / 797 notes Roy Haynes, tap-dancing along with Chick Corea’s clapping, New York City.  2 years ago / 688 notes BJ Novak, whose book just came out, the photo on which is in color, something I’m told that most publishers insist on these days, these days meaning the past thirty years, but I guess I was thinking a real Shel Silverstein thing, and you know what, no big loss, the photo on his book looks great.  2 years ago / 905 notes Older → © 2009–2016 JOHN MAYER | Sharp Theme by UltraLinx Powered by Tumblr
