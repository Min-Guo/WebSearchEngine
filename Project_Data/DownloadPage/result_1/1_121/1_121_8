"I've been marketing on the web for over 10 years and the events put on by Social Media Examiner provide not only excellent education and superior networking opportunities, they are also very well organized. Worth the money." George Williams Dear Fellow Marketer; Have you ever looked at successful blogs and thought, "I wish I had that?" If so, you and I are a lot alike. When I started Social Media Examiner, there were thousands of other social media blogs. But I didn't let that stop me. I grew Social Media Examiner into one of the largest business blogs in the world�and it rapidly grew our business into a multimillion-dollar company. Social Media Examiner is one of the world's largest business blogs. All of our growth came from the blog. We never advertised. Instead, we built a steady base of more than 800,000 monthly readers on the back of excellent content (and smart strategy). Business blogging allows you to become "the source" that people turn to, reference and frequent. And when that happens, you can rapidly grow your business. That's what Blogging Fundamentals for Business is all about. I'll reveal to you the very principles and techniques I used to build Social Media Examiner. And I'll show you how they can work for you. Over the course of five sessions, this workshop provides you with the strategy, plans and tools you need to build a successful business blog (or revive a struggling one).
