We contribute to improving the census of cool brown dwarfs (late-T and Y dwarfs) in the immediate solar neighbourhood. Methods. By combining near-infrared (NIR) data of UKIDSS with mid-infrared WISE and other available NIR (2MASS) and red optical (SDSS z-band) multi-epoch data we detected high proper motion (HPM) objects with colours typical of late spectral types (>T5). We used NIR low-resolution spectroscopy for the classification of new candidates. Results. We determined new proper motions for 14 known T5.5-Y0 dwarfs, many of which are significantly (>2–10 times) more accurate than previous ones. We detected three new candidates, ULAS J0954+0623, ULAS J1152+0359, and ULAS J1204−0150, by their HPMs and colours. Using previously published and new UKIDSS positions of the known nearby T8 dwarf WISE J0254+0223 we improved its trigonometric parallax to 165 ± 20 mas. For the three new objects we obtained NIR spectroscopic follow-up with LBT/LUCIFER classifying them as T5.5 and T6 dwarfs. With their estimated spectroscopic distances of about 25–30 pc, their proper motions of about 430–650 mas/yr lead to tangential velocities of about 50–80 km s-1, typical of the Galactic thin-disk population.

The OpenURL standard is a protocol for transmission of metadata describing the resource that you wish to access. An OpenURL link contains article metadata and directs it to the OpenURL server of your choice. The OpenURL server can provide access to the resource and also offer complementary services (specific search engine, export of references...). The OpenURL link can be generated by different means. If your librarian has set up your subscription with an OpenURL resolver, OpenURL links appear automatically on the abstract pages. You can define your own OpenURL resolver with your EDPS Account. In this case your choice will be given priority over that of your library. You can use an add-on for your browser (Firefox or I.E.) to display OpenURL links on a page (see http://www.openly.com/openurlref/). You should disable this module if you wish to use the OpenURL server that you or your library have defined. Editor-in-Chief: T. Forveille Letters Editor-in-Chief: J. Alves Managing Editor: N.
