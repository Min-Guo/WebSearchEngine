Date Description Date Description Date Description Date Description Message Name Description Name Description Name Description Name Description April 14 pretty / April 14 victorpopejr: People will watch “The Real Housewives” of anything tag to look at when sad / vines / April 14 you-fell-in-love-with-a-unicorn: Haven't said how awesome you are in awhile. <3 <3. mysteryandnonstopfun: i have been having a hard time this past couple of days. Your message means a lot!! THANKS THANKS THANKS!!  <3 / April 14 beautiful / pink / April 14 I'm not exaggerating... Friend that grew up poor:  Ehh...pizza is on me this time. Don't worry about it ;) Friend that grew up rich:  We need to calculate the value of everyone's meals with an Excel spreadsheet. I can't let you borrow $2 for McDonald's because you forgot your wallet. April 14 bluespock: roses are red violets are blue if you cut me off again haha / love it / star trek / tos / April 14 lizardbby: listen i love women, i LOVE them. but if u r a feminist & believe that women are capable of anything, u also have to recognize that women are capable of being evil and sadistic and malicious. because the point of feminism is that women are human beings. they are not ethereal beings who can Do No Wrong. women make mistakes and they commit crimes and they hurt people. blindly praising all women for being perfect is actively harmful to people who have been hurt and abused by women and also to women as a group because we are NOT perfect! we are human and that is the whole damn point my dude. April 14 commanderoftheclones: ORPHAN BLACK IS COMING BACK TONIGHT AND THIS IS HOW IM CURRENTLY DEALING WITH THAT FACT i completely forgot! i am not prepared, oh no, orphan black / good thing i saw this / don't want to miss it / <3 / April 14 ibeggedformercytwice: #’TONY I HAVE DISCOVERED THE WONDERS OF BUBBLE BATHS’ #’not now honey I’m in the middle of a HOLY SHIT’ Whoever joined these gifs together, well done.  <3<3 / stony / love this / tag to look at when sad / steve rogers / tony stark / April 14 lipoil: A lot of people should calm down me / k.
