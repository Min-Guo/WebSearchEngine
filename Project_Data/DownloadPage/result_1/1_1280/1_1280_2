The Board decides on the policies for A&A which include the general guidelines for publishing, the selection of the Editors, the various financial aspects, as well as the membership of countries. Recent changes at A&A The Board of Directors of A&A has over recent years decided to adjust some of the policies. The changes include: All A&A articles are in open access ONE year after their publication date (read more) The open access policy is updated (read more) The A&A authors have the possibility of being identified with non-Roman alphabets, such as Chinese, Japanese, Cyrillic characters (read more) The most recent issue of A&A is available free of charge for users registering for the service. A&A offers free of charge an e-mail alert service for registered readers. Exceptionally interesting papers are brought to the attention of the general public by way of press releases on such papers. Submitted papers will, if the authors agree, obtain a DOI-number, which identifies the paper bibliographically in a unique way and which allows to associate early references to the paper with the final version. The lay-out of the pages has been adjusted to make better use of the available space. Language editing is provided for most papers; this service is much appreciated by the authors.
