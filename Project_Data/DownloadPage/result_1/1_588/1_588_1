An Aquarist is an individual that cares for the marine life in aquariums by maintaining their living environments and having hands on interactions with the creatures. What Does an Aquarist Do? Aquarists may perform several different functions depending on their exact position. Many are directly involved with caring for marine life and properly maintaining the quality of their habitats. They may care for the creatures by feeding them, providing activities for more intelligent creatures, or capturing sick animals so they can be seen by a vet. They may upkeep the aquarium exhibits by monitoring the cleanliness and temperature of the tanks, cleaning the environments, or fixing damaged equipment. In addition, they may provide presentations to visitors or design exhibits for the aquarium. Where Does an Aquarist Work? Most Aquarists work in aquariums, private facilities where fish and other marine life are kept in captivity to educate the public. Though this profession spends a great deal of time working hands on with marine life, they may also find themselves working in office environments when designing exhibits or giving presentations to visitors. Aquarists may also be required to perform fieldwork outdoors, meaning that they must travel to other locations to collect specimens that could be used in the aquarium. This career path often requires a great deal of physical activity and time spent in the water. Most work part-time schedules and irregular hours are common, as many animals demand 24-hour care. Fieldwork may also require extensive travel and overtime hours. What Is the Average Aquarist Salary? Aquarists earn an average of $19,970 per year, with the highest 10% earning around $32,500 and the lowest 10% earning around $16,490.
