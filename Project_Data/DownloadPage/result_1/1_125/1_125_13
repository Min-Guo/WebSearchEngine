Du JunDiscussion  -  2016-04-12   Hi anyone,  I have a question about tango hardware.  My PC can't recognize tango device,  I means there is  no any infomation when  I plug it to PC usb(3.0) directly form Tango or form mini dock(power on) . So I can't even install google usb drivers for it .  And I am sure I turn on ADB and usb debug option. My system is win10， what‘s wrong with it?  ﻿Read moreShow less 1 1 comment Chuck Knowledge + 0 1 0   Open Device Manager and see if there is an entry for the device, perhaps with an exclamation mark by it. Open the properties and manually update the driver. If you have installed the SDK you can download the USB driver through the SDK manager or Android Studio. The driver will be inside the extras folder inside your SDK location.﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment... Sam MaliszewskiDiscussion  -  2016-04-11   The following is a bit of a rant/PSA/feature request. The timestamp from the tango’s color camera is from the start of the camera’s exposure. When a tango pose is requested from that timestamp, it returns the camera’s pose at that specific moment in time. Cameras often move during an exposure. It may not be in the same position at the end of an exposure, as it was at the start. An exposure could be thought of as a combination of several moments over a period of time. In photography this is seen as motion blur. Taking the camera’s pose from the beginning of the exposure is not technically “wrong”. The camera was at that pose at some point during it’s exposure. However it makes a lot more sense to take the camera’s pose from the middle of the exposure. It’s the average pose of the entire image, and in my opinion it makes the track look a lot more “stable”, and have less “wobble”. If the camera/tablet is mostly steady, or if you have a short exposure, wobble isn’t very noticeable, or that discernible from a general tracking error. But on shakier footage, or with a longer exposure, it is. The difference between the pose at start of the exposure, and at the middle of the exposure becomes greater, and the tracking appears to be out of sync. So the solution is pretty straight forward. Take the length of the camera’s exposure, cut it in half, add it to the timestamp, and get the pose from that moment in time. The problem is there is no way to read the exposure time for the color camera using the Tango SDK. In theory we can turn off auto exposure and manually set the exposure time. However this feature seems to be broken in the latest OTA for both C and Java, and this has never been an option for the Unity plugin. It would be great to see some more love for manual color camera controls, especially now that the Hardware Abstraction Layer has been added. In a perfect world it would be a runtime config like Depth Framerate, so that users could implement their own auto exposure if necessary, and still be able to know the exposure time. Has anyone else had issues with color exposure on Izar? Or have a better name for this technique other than inter-frame sync? Thanks!﻿Read moreShow less The importance of inter-frame synchronization 7 6 comments Tisham Dhar + 0 1 0   +Sam Maliszewski  Here is a sample of our work - http://aero3dpro.com.au/gallery .

Jacob FunchDiscussion  -  2016-04-10   What's the best way to avoid walking into objects such as tables, chairs and walls? I've developed a prototype which measures the average depth to what's in front of you, but it seem to not take smaller objects into consideration. Can I narrow the view so it measures what's right in front of you? Can I instead of calculating the average depth do a more precise calculation? Can I take objects that are below your wraist into the calculation?﻿Read moreShow less 1 3 comments Aaron Pulkka + 0 1 0   You may want to look at the Unity mesh builder in the Project Tango sample code. Rather than analyzing the point cloud directly, you could build and refine a mesh based on the depth data - then experiment with using collision objects to find where you would collide with that mesh. Just one possible direction you could explore. Good luck!﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

Christian SteinmeyerDiscussion  -  2016-04-14   Hi everyone! I'm about to start my Bachelor's thesis (estimated workload of around 180 programming hours and 180 hours of actual writing the thesis). As I have zero experience with Google's project Tango, I don't know whether my goal is achievable at all or way too big without me realizing it. I would like to develop a "blueprint app" that uses Tango to create a blueprint of a scanned area. I.e. I want to go around my apartment with the device in my hand, scan it and afterwards have a file in which I can see all the dimensions of all rooms, see doors (and windows?), but not see things lying around like cloths, books, even shelves, chairs or my guitar. I believe that this is generally possible with Tango, although I can imagine it to be quiet hard, as soon as I want to include some data but exclude other. To be clear: My goal is not to create the most advanced app that handles 100% of possible cases, but rather have a nice tool that automates the easy parts of creating floor plans and needs post-processing in some (complicated) cases. I realize that an answer heavily depends on the person. I have a little more than 3 years of programming experience in Java. And I have developed a small Android app so that I know the fundamentals of lifecycles etc. My last programming project was a simple web shop including a restful Spring backend, and an AngularJS frontend. I use frameworks where possible and so far don't seem to have bigger problems with google's APIs. So my question is: Am I crazy to even think that's possible or do you (people with knowledge of Tango) think it could be done?﻿Read moreShow less 1 4 comments Paul Freeman + 1 2 1   You might want to divide your goals into easy ones and stretch goals and document why you selected them.

Benjamin WonderDiscussion  -  2016-04-13   Hey :)  Has anybody a working example for NFC reading inside of Unity with the Tango?  I can't get it working. What I did: Created a Unity plugin (.jar) with Android Studio (http://pastebin.com/8TxC51ty) In Unity I call: AndroidJavaClass unity = new AndroidJavaClass ("com.unity3d.player.UnityPlayer"); AndroidJavaObject currentActivity = unity.GetStatic<AndroidJavaObject> ("currentActivity"); string value = currentActivity.Call<string>("GetValue");    But I have a conflict in the AndroidManifest.xml: The problem I have is that there are two activitys in the manifest with the Main and Launcher intent filter  ( <action android:name="android.intent.action.MAIN" />   <category android:name="android.intent.category.LAUNCHER" />) One for  <activity android:name="com.google.unity.GoogleUnityActivity" and one for my plugin  <activity android:name="com.test.testlayout.MainActivity" When booth activities have the intent filter main and launcher there are two icons created on the device when I compile the app. When just com.google.unity.GoogleUnityActivity has the main and launcher intent filter the tango framework works but not my plugin. And when my plugin activity has the launcher and main intent filter my plugin works but not the tango framework. Could anybody help me? ﻿Read moreShow less [Java] package com.test.testlayout; import java.nio.charset.Charset; import java.ut - Pastebin.com pastebin.com 1 3 comments Woldo Wondare + 0 1 0   just checked, NFC is working in general. though i don't know about your unity issue.﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

Karel KnoestReal Estate & Architecture  -  2016-04-13   Hi all (+Project Tango) I would love to integrate 180+ degree color panorama capture in a Tango application, similar to how Google's Cardboard camera allows continuous capture by a user. The combination of user friendly wide angle image capture, camera motion tracking and 3D structure is promising for indoors environments. Any tips for finding / setting up such panorama capture are very welcome; the more out of the box, the better. Building a stitching pipeline on OpenCV is an option, but from past experience it still takes a lot of work to get it smoothly working on indoor environments without ghosting. That the typical user doesn't keep the camera exactly in the same place complicates things ;). As far as I can find, no Google library is available that does Cardboard camera like stitching.﻿Read moreShow less 1 Add a comment...
