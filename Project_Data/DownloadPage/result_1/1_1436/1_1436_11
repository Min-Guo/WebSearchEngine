After imprisonment for being associated with the short-lived Bavarian Communist republic in 1919, Neurath went to Vienna (1920) to encourage political and social reform based on Marxist ideology. In an effort to increase communication between scientific disciplines, he organized international conferences on scientific philosophy and edited the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science (1937), the principal effort of his Institute for the Unity of Science, which he had founded at The Hague in 1936, two years after moving to the Netherlands. The war years from 1941 to 1945 he spent at Oxford. Neurath’s other writings explored classification systems (Foundations of the Social Sciences, 1944; rev. ed. 1947), comparative sociology (Empirische Soziologie, 1931), and economics (“Inventory of the Standard of Living,” monograph, 1935).
