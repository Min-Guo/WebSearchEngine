To make these concepts more tangible, three graduate students at San Francisco State University (SFSU)--Jason Burmark, Moses Lee and Omar Shaikh--have created <a href="http://solarsimulator.tech/">Solar Simulator</a>, a new app for <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/">Project Tango</a>. The app lets people take a virtual walk through space to understand the size and scale of our solar system.</p> <p>Created with the <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity SDK</a>, the application lays out our solar system’s planets in their relative distances from each other and draws 3D models of them in their relative sizes. The app leverages Project Tango’s motion-tracking API to track your movements as you walk, so you can better understand the planets and their distance in space.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mBgn-gHWOHw/VxAG5YDvEpI/AAAAAAAABcA/7WfWPuPAaasAk6FVZWEk1exba7MR4yHqACLcB/s1600/image01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mBgn-gHWOHw/VxAG5YDvEpI/AAAAAAAABcA/7WfWPuPAaasAk6FVZWEk1exba7MR4yHqACLcB/s640/image01.png" /></a></div> <p>If you like what you see, you can create your own solar system at home. Just follow the six steps below:</p><OL TYPE=1><LI>Download the Tango <a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download">Unity SDK</a>. <LI>Create a new Unity project and import the Tango SDK package into the project.

Beacons mark important places and objects in a way that your phone can understand. To do this, they typically broadcast public one-way signals ‒ such as an Eddystone-UID or -URL.<br /><br />Today, we're introducing Ephemeral IDs (EID), a beacon frame in the Eddystone format that gives developers more power to control who can make use of the beacon signal. Eddystone-EID enables a new set of use cases where it is important for users to be able to exchange information securely and privately. Since the beacon frame changes periodically, the signal is only useful to clients with access to a resolution service that maps the beacon’s current identifier to stable data. In other words, the signal is only recognizable to a controlled set of users. In this post we’ll provide a bit more detail about this feature, as well as Google’s implementation of <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone-eid?utm_campaign=beacons_launch_ephemeralidentifiers_041416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">Eddystone-EID</a> with Google Cloud Platform’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/proximity/guides?utm_campaign=beacons_launch_ephemeralidentifiers_041416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">Proximity Beacon API</a> and the Nearby API for Android and CocoaPod for iOS.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Technical Specifications</b><br /><br />To an observer of an Eddystone-EID beacon, the AES-encrypted eight byte beacon identifier changes pseudo-randomly with an average period that is set by the developer ‒ over a range from 1 second to just over 9 hours. The identifier is generated using a key and timer running on the beacon. When the beacon is provisioned, or set up, the key is generated and exchanged with a resolution service such as Proximity Beacon API using an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_curve_Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman">protocol</a>, and the timer is synchronized with the service. This way, only the beacon and the service that it is registered with have access to the key. You can read more about the technical details of Eddystone-EID from the <a href="https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-eid">specification</a> ‒ including the provisioning process ‒ on GitHub, or from our recent <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone-eid-preprint.pdf?utm_campaign=beacons_launch_ephemeralidentifiers_041416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog"> preprint</a>.<br /><br />An Eddystone-EID contains measures designed to prevent a variety of nuanced attacks. For example, the rotation period for a single beacon varies slightly from identifier to identifier, meaning that an attacker cannot use a consistent period to identify a particular beacon. Eddystone-EID also enables safety features such as proximity awareness, device authentication, and data encryption on packet transmission. The <a href="https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/eddystone-tlm/tlm-encrypted.md"> Eddystone-TLM</a> frame has also been extended with a new version that broadcasts battery level also encrypted with the shared key, meaning that an attacker cannot use the battery level as an identifying feature either.<br /><br />When correctly implemented and combined with a service that supports a range of access control checks, such as Proximity Beacon API, this pattern has several advantages:<br /><ul><li>The beacon’s location cannot be spoofed, except by a real-time relay of the beacon signal. This makes it ideal for use cases where a developer wishes to enable premium features for a user at a location.</li><li>Beacons provide a high-quality and precise location signal that is valuable to the deployer. Eddystone-EID enables deployers to decide which developers/businesses can make use of that signal.</li><li>Eddystone-EID beacons can be integrated into devices that users carry with them without leaving users vulnerable to tracking.</li></ul><div><b>Integrating Seamlessly with the Google Beacon Platform</b><br /><br />Launching today on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.location.beacon.beacontools"> Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/beacon-tools/id1094371356?ls=1&amp;mt=8"> iOS</a>, is a new addition to the wider Google beacon platform: Beacon Tools. Beacon Tools allows you to provision and register an Eddystone-EID beacon, as well as associate content with your beacon through the Google Cloud Platform.<br /><br />In addition to Eddystone-EID and the new encrypted version of the previously available Eddystone-TLM, we’re also adding a common configuration protocol to the Eddystone family. The <a href="https://github.com/google/eddystone/tree/master/configuration-service"> Eddystone GATT service</a> allows any Eddystone beacon to be provisioned by any tool that supports the protocol. This encourages the development of an open ecosystem of beacon products, both in hardware and software, removing restrictions for developers.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Eddystone-EID Support in the Beacon Industry</b><br /><br />We’re excited to have worked with a variety of industry players as Eddystone-EID develops. Over the past year, Eddystone <a href="https://developers.google.com/beacons/eddystone?utm_campaign=beacons_launch_ephemeralidentifiers_041416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog#beacon_manufacturers">manufacturers</a> in the beacon space have grown from 5 to over 25.

Check out ways you can also use flexibility to your advantage with these tips:<br /><br /><br /><b>1. Adapt quickly to promising platforms and opportunities.</b><br /><br />MobiSytems started over 10 years ago. In its early days, they created dictionaries for the most popular platforms – PalmOS and Pocket PC. When a new platform popped up called Symbian, they were quick to build for it, with some success.<br /><br />Then Android came along in 2007, and Elitza saw the opportunity, despite the business being resource constrained.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>“It was clear that mobile devices were becoming more popular for working professionals. The trend was clear. While we did opt-out of building for smaller platforms, this opportunity was in line with our vision and it seemed promising. It seemed like a platform where our target users would be. It was a risk, but we took it.”</i></blockquote><br />The risk paid off. Being one of the earliests apps on the Google Play Store, and being pre-loaded on thousands of devices helped boost MobiSystems presence. Android as a platform significantly grew, expanding the user base that MobiSystems had access to.<br /><br />MobiSystem’s most recent analysis of their target audience revealed that 15-20% of their users have devices on more than one platform. They’re now working on a new iteration of their products that allows users to use one license to access the app on multiple platforms.<br /><br /><b>2. Be flexible with your monetization strategy.</b><br /><br />MobiSystem’s early users were accustomed to only one type of app monetization model from business apps – paying for access to premium versions. As consumer apps became successful with new models, the MobiSystems team was eager to adopt new monetization features in Android.<br /><br />Since profiting from in-app purchases was a business model they could easily adopt, they decided to offer a version of their app for free with an in-app subscription to gain access to premium features. They saw a huge spike in downloads but some initial decline in revenues.To solve this, they turned to a monetization model that business apps never tried before—in-app advertising.<br /><br />Transitioning to ads did take some time, but worked out positively. By starting slowly, experimenting with placement, being committed to showing high quality ads, and being clear that ads were critical in supporting their free version, MobiSystem bridged their revenue gap and built a successful business. Best of all, they’re able to sustainably offer a useful app for free. One of their products, OfficeSuite, has over 100,000 daily installs and has been consistently on the top free apps list in the the Play Store’s business categories.<br /><br />When considering your app’s monetization strategy, consider all of <a href="https://services.google.com/fb/forms/admobmonetizationguide/?utm_source=Blog&amp;utm_medium=In-Article&amp;utm_campaign=IM-AdMob-Monetization-Education" target="_blank">your options</a> thoroughly.

In the first few episodes, we’ll teach you the ropes of machine learning without requiring any major prerequisites (like calculus). As the series progresses, we’ll walk you from “Hello World” to solving some real world problems.</p> <p>Episodes will generally publish bi-weekly, and be only about 5-10 minutes in length to keep the material lightweight. Occasionally, we’ll have guests on the show who work with machine learning on different teams around Google.</p> <p>Ep #1: Hello World.</p><ul> <li>Six lines of Python is all it takes to write your first machine learning program! In this episode, we'll briefly introduce what machine learning is and why it's important. Then, we'll follow a recipe for supervised learning (a technique to create a classifier from examples) and code it up.</li></ul> <!--[Interactive video] --><iframe width="557" height="370" " frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKxRvEZd3Mw?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal"" style="box-shadow: 3px 10px 18px 1px #999; display: block; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left: 80px;" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Also: Coffee with a Googler came to NYC!

Real estate websites may include descriptions of the dining room, but it's nothing like actually touring the home. For developers, having immersive elements in their apps and websites can be the difference between meh and magical. That's why we're introducing VR view—a quick and easy way to embed immersive content on Android, iOS and the web.</p> <iframe class="vrview" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen width="100%" height="300px" src="//storage.googleapis.com/vrview/index.html?image=//storage.googleapis.com/vrview/examples/coral.jpg&preview=//storage.googleapis.com/vrview/examples/coral-preview.jpg&is_stereo=true"></iframe> <p>VR views take 360 VR images or videos and transform them into interactive experiences that users can view on their phone, with a <a href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/get-cardboard/">Cardboard viewer</a>, or on their desktop computer. For native apps, you can <a href="http://developers.google.com/cardboard/vrview/?utm_campaign=cardboard_launch_vrview_033016&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">embed a VR view</a> by grabbing the latest Cardboard SDK for <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/android/?utm_campaign=cardboard_launch_vrview_033016&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">Android</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/cardboard/ios/?utm_campaign=cardboard_launch_vrview_033016&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">iOS*</a> and adding a few lines of code. On the web, embedding a VR view is as simple as adding an iframe on your site. We’re open-sourcing the HTML and JavaScript for web developers on <a href="http://github.com/google/vrview">github</a>, so you can self-host and modify it to match your needs.</p> <p>From travel and real estate to news and entertainment, we hope embeddable VR views make it quick and easy to share your story and build immersive and engaging visual experiences your users will love. We're excited to see what you create.</p> <p>*Yes, you read that right! Starting today, there’ll be a native Cardboard SDK for iOS. Provided in idiomatic Objective C, and packaged as a single, easy-to-use CocoaPod, this new SDK includes all of the features already available in the Cardboard SDK for Android.</p> <script>function DeviceMotionSender(){if(!this.isIOS_()){return}window.addEventListener("devicemotion",this.onDeviceMotion_.bind(this),false);this.iframes=document.querySelectorAll("iframe.vrview")}DeviceMotionSender.prototype.onDeviceMotion_=function(e){var message={type:"DeviceMotion",deviceMotionEvent:this.cloneDeviceMotionEvent_(e)};for(var i=0;i<this.iframes.length;i++){var iframe=this.iframes[i];var iframeWindow=iframe.contentWindow;if(this.isCrossDomainIframe_(iframe)){iframeWindow.postMessage(message,"*")}}};DeviceMotionSender.prototype.cloneDeviceMotionEvent_=function(e){return{acceleration:{x:e.acceleration.x,y:e.acceleration.y,z:e.acceleration.z},accelerationIncludingGravity:{x:e.accelerationIncludingGravity.x,y:e.accelerationIncludingGravity.y,z:e.accelerationIncludingGravity.z},rotationRate:{alpha:e.rotationRate.alpha,beta:e.rotationRate.beta,gamma:e.rotationRate.gamma},interval:e.interval}};DeviceMotionSender.prototype.isIOS_=function(){return/iPad|iPhone|iPod/.test(navigator.userAgent)&&!window.MSStream};DeviceMotionSender.prototype.isCrossDomainIframe_=function(iframe){var html=null;try{var doc=iframe.contentDocument||iframe.contentWindow.document;html=doc.body.innerHTML}catch(err){}return html===null};var dms=new DeviceMotionSender; </script><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/ly72D7wv7Wo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/introducing-vr-view-embed-immersive.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-79746618724667956952016-03-24T15:25:00.000-07:002016-03-24T15:25:48.875-07:00 Introducing the Google API Console<p><i>Posted by Israel Shalom, Product Manager</i></p> <p>Every day, hundreds of thousands of developers send millions of requests to Google APIs, from <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/?utm_campaign=developer console_launch_api_console_launch_032416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">Maps</a> to <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/?utm_campaign=developer console_launch_api_console_launch_032416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">YouTube</a>. Thousands of developers visit the <a href="http://console.developers.google.com?utm_campaign=developer console_launch_api_console_launch_032416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">console</a> for credentials, quota, and more -- and we want to give them a better and more streamlined experience.</p> <p>Starting today, we’ll gradually roll out the API Console at <a href="http://console.developers.google.com?utm_campaign=developer console_launch_api_console_launch_032416&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">console.developers.google.com</a> focusing entirely on your Google API experience. There, you’ll find a significantly cleaner, simpler interface: instead of 20+ sections in the navigation bar, you’ll see API Manager, Billing and Permissions only:</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gswSk97-4sA/VvRh_0qW1wI/AAAAAAAABbQ/zuBhPHu5nIoMHvisZszg8ZQGLkeDF3N1A/s1600/Overview.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gswSk97-4sA/VvRh_0qW1wI/AAAAAAAABbQ/zuBhPHu5nIoMHvisZszg8ZQGLkeDF3N1A/s640/Overview.png" /></a></div><p><center><i>Figure 1: API Console home page</i></center></p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OeKfq-zBnfI/VvRiNcWRyNI/AAAAAAAABbY/nXRhlQamq4QeLP7zyuhc-29TjBmfq4szg/s1600/Gallery.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OeKfq-zBnfI/VvRiNcWRyNI/AAAAAAAABbY/nXRhlQamq4QeLP7zyuhc-29TjBmfq4szg/s640/Gallery.png" /></a></div><p><center><i>Figure 2: Navigation section for API Console</i></center></p> <p><a href="http://console.cloud.google.com">console.cloud.google.com</a> will remain unchanged. It’ll point to Cloud console, which includes the entire suite of Google Cloud Platform services, just like before. And while the two are different destinations, your underlying resources remain the same: projects created on Cloud Console will still be accessible on API Console, and vice versa.</p> <p>The purpose of the new API Console is to let you complete common API-related tasks quickly. For instance, we know that once you enable an API in a new project, the next step is usually to create credentials. That’s why we’ve built the credentials wizard: a quick and convenient way for you to figure out what kind of credentials you need, and add them right after enabling an API:</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zdi45DD2vb0/VvRifMvyuVI/AAAAAAAABbg/z9_EXLUNde0J_JfYGClHH1x4-jxTsNyow/s1600/Enabled-API.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zdi45DD2vb0/VvRifMvyuVI/AAAAAAAABbg/z9_EXLUNde0J_JfYGClHH1x4-jxTsNyow/s640/Enabled-API.png" /></a></div><p><center><i>Figure 3: After enabling an API, you’re prompted to go to Credentials</i></center></p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ol9Eaqiovrc/VvRiSxlaPXI/AAAAAAAABbc/eNZxFnzZPGgxyTl25uZHAIAMDij7DBbkg/s1600/Credentials.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ol9Eaqiovrc/VvRiSxlaPXI/AAAAAAAABbc/eNZxFnzZPGgxyTl25uZHAIAMDij7DBbkg/s640/Credentials.png" /></a></div> <p><center><i>Figure 4: Credentials wizard</i></center></p> <p>Over time, we will continue to tailor the API Console experience for the many developers out there who use Google’s APIs. So if you’re one of these users, we encourage you to try out API Console and use the feedback button to let us know what you think!</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/wtKlDk13sg8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/introducing-google-api-console.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-24192341963460039662016-03-23T14:10:00.002-07:002016-03-23T14:13:58.683-07:00 Register today for Google Code Jam<i><p>Posted by Chelsea Lax, <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ChelseaLax/posts">Google Code Jam Team</a></p></i> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0XMMLu4tPPM/VvMHD8N0c_I/AAAAAAAABac/MchjfZsHp6Y2dyx_wlk9LnnBSFHX57V_Q/s1600/image00.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0XMMLu4tPPM/VvMHD8N0c_I/AAAAAAAABac/MchjfZsHp6Y2dyx_wlk9LnnBSFHX57V_Q/s640/image00.png" /></a></div> <p>Google Code Jam is here!

Look no further than Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and spend your summer break working on an exciting open source project, learning how to write code.</p> <p>For twelve years running, GSoC gives participants a chance to work on an open source software project entirely online. Students, who receive a stipend for their successful contributions, are paired with mentors who can help address technical questions and concerns throughout the program. Former GSoC participants have told us that the real-world experience they’ve gained during the program has not only sharpened their technical skills, but has also boosted their confidence, broadened their professional network and enhanced their resumes.</p> <p>Students who are interested can submit proposals on the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">program site</a> now through Friday, March 25 at 19:00 UTC. The first step is to review the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/">180 open source projects</a> and find project ideas that appeal to you.

We agree. Which is why we’re excited to announce that Opaque has just released the beta version of their <a href="http://www.opaque.media/project-tango-plugin">Project Tango plugin!</a> Stop by our booth at GDC to learn more (Zone 1, Booth 612), and to see all the newest Project Tango games in action. We’re also hosting two talks we think you’ll like:</p> <ul> <li><b>Wednesday March 16th, 11-11:20 am:</b> Jesse Schell, CEO of Schell Games, discusses building with Tango and demonstrates his company’s apps</li> <li><b>Thursday March 17th, 12:30 -12:50 pm:</b> Randall Eike, President of Eike Consulting and Daniel Winkler, Lead Programmer at Iguanabee introduce two new Tango-powered games, Raise and Slingshot Islands </li></ul> <p>In the meantime, enjoy an in-depth interview with game developers Danielle Swank and Jim Fleming of Barking Mouse Studio, and Josh Lee of Floor is Lava. The three recently met up at Gamenest, and created a brand new Project Tango game, World of Orbles.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-170Pru7Yi6U/VucWEPbMvvI/AAAAAAAABZY/Fc5Ah9qB9-EBiDzPX7xtavSeRJLQX-ZUQ/s1600/image01.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-170Pru7Yi6U/VucWEPbMvvI/AAAAAAAABZY/Fc5Ah9qB9-EBiDzPX7xtavSeRJLQX-ZUQ/s640/image01.jpg" /></a></div> <P><b>Tell us about The World of Orbles</b></P> <P><i>Danielle:</i> The World of Orbles is a real-time strategy game that deals with fictional creatures called Orbles. Orbles are very smart and can build really amazing things, like trans-dimensional portals, but they also have a tendency to get distracted and forget to double check their math. So when their trans-dimensional portal malfunctions and leaves them stranded, it’s no surprise to anyone. Chaos ensues as you try to get the Orbles back to their home dimension. By using Project Tango AR features, you can see the Orbles right in your physical environment.</P> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-up_iWuaOQws/VucWKWeCBmI/AAAAAAAABZc/BA6kc5K00scYDO0mJAaZXmiW2q-cclypw/s1600/image00.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-up_iWuaOQws/VucWKWeCBmI/AAAAAAAABZc/BA6kc5K00scYDO0mJAaZXmiW2q-cclypw/s640/image00.jpg" /></a></div> <b><P>What got you excited about developing for Project Tango?</b></P> <P><i>Jim</i>: Mixed reality is really compelling. Literally placing something you’ve created into the real world and being able to walk around it feels like the future.<P> <P><i>Josh</i>: A lot of my work involves playing in physical spaces, and Project Tango's ability to map a real room and blend digital objects with it opens up all kinds of new possibilities for gameplay.</P> <P><b>How do you think Project Tango enhances your user’s experience?</b></P> <P><i>Josh:</i> Giving users the ability to engage with digital games the way they would with a physical space is extremely powerful. Interacting with digital objects in a more physical way – looking at them from different angles, tracking their movement, etc. – makes it possible for users to play games much more intuitively, with less fiddling around with camera controls and such.</P> <P><b>What is your favorite Project Tango feature? </b></P> <P><i>Jim:</i> Real-time mesh generation and out-of-the-box Unity integration.</P> <P><i>Josh:</i> Building a digital model of a physical room in real time is pretty hard to beat.</P> <P><b>What was your biggest hurdle getting starting with Project Tango?</b></P> <P><i>Danielle:</i> Having to write our own pathfinding was an unexpected hurdle. We normally rely on Unity and static environments to provide character and npc movements. Since it’s dynamic, you can’t use Project Tango’s area mesh generation with the Unity pathfinding. Instead we had to rely on ray casting against the depth map that the Tango generates and use a modified boids algorithm to control our npcs.</P> <P><b>What creative solution did you come up when using Project Tango for your app? </b></P> <P><i>Danielle:</i> We had to come up with a creative solution to what happens with our characters if they move behind a real-world object so we decided to write a glitch shader. It transitions the character from visible to hidden in a believable manner since we can’t partially occlude game objects.</P> <P><b>What resources were most helpful for you?</P></b> <P><i>Danielle:</i> The Project Tango developer docs and just reading the Unity integration. There a lot of good information in the source code. Also having Unity experience was really helpful.</P> <P><b>What tip would you give a developer who wants to get started with Project Tango</b></P> <P><i>Danielle: </i>Getting the game characters to look like they are part of the environment was tough. It’s definitely harder to make an AR game then a normal game, so be sure to give yourself enough time. That all said, I think there are all sorts of possibilities for AR that you can’t do with a normal game.</P> <P><i>Jim:</i> You’ll have to get creative when working with AR. Some things you would do in a normal game don’t make sense in AR.</P> <P><b>What are you most excited to see with a the launch of Lenovo’s phone with Project Tango?</b></P> <P><i>Danielle:</i> I’m excited to see the devices in a lot of people’s hands. I think it’s really awesome that I can build a world that’s different than everyday reality and share it with people around the globe.</P><P><i>Jim:</i> The smaller phone form factor opens up more use cases such as Cardboard.</P> <P><i>Josh:</i> I want to go to an AR gaming party, where all the partiers bring their Tango-enabled devices to a special location and play crazy games together.</P><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/RcFkNLnYKxU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/project-tango-heads-to-gdc-with-new.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-4301365568390451472016-03-14T10:08:00.000-07:002016-03-14T10:08:26.836-07:00 Grow your games business on Google Play: Game parameters management, video recording, streaming ads, and more<i><p>Originally posted on <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2016/03/grow-your-games-business-on-google-play.html">Android Developers blog</a></P></i><i><p>Posted by Morgan Dollard, Product Manager of Google Play Games</p></i> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9wibpF5Phs0/VubnbJfiprI/AAAAAAAABYg/TVSE7O7-yGYr_gCoBlObBc6DRve90LoIw/s1600/image06.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9wibpF5Phs0/VubnbJfiprI/AAAAAAAABYg/TVSE7O7-yGYr_gCoBlObBc6DRve90LoIw/s100/image06.png" /></a></div><p>With mobile gamers across 190 countries, Google Play Games is made up of a vibrant and diverse gaming community. And these players are more engaged than ever. Over the past year, the number of games reaching over 1 million installs grew by 50 percent.</p> <p>Today, at our annual <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/gdc-developer-day-2016/">Developer Day</a> at the Game Developers Conference, we announced new platform and ads tools for developers, of all sizes reach, to reach this global audience and accelerate the growth of their games business. Check out below the full range of features that will help game developers build their apps, grow their users base, and earn more revenue.</p> <h3>Making Google Play Games better for players</h3> <p>In February, we <a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.co.uk/2016/02/embrace-your-inner-gaming-hero-with.html">introduced Gamer IDs</a> so that anyone could create a gaming persona. We also simplified the sign-in process for Google Play Games so players could pick up playing their game more quickly. We’re also working on product enhancements to make Play Games a little more social and fun, which will mean more engaged players who’re playing your game for longer. One example is the launch of <b>Gamer friends</b> (coming soon!), where your players can add and interact with their friends from within the Google Play Games app (without needing a Google+ account).</p> <p>We’re also launching the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/collection/promotion_3001ed4_indie_corner">Indie Corner</a>, a new collection on Google Play, that will highlight amazing games built by indie developers. You can nominate your awesome indie game for inclusion at <a href="http://g.co/indiecornersubmission">g.co/indiecornersubmission</a>. We’ll pick the best games to showcase based on the quality of the experience and exemplary use of Google Play game services.</p> <h3>Grow your game with powerful new features from Google Play game services </h3> <p>In January, we <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.co.uk/2016/01/new-features-to-better-understand.html">added features to Player Analytics</a>, the free reporting tool of Google Play game services, which helps you understand how players are progressing, spending and churning.

TapBlaze has developed over 15 titles, collectively garnering millions of downloads. Anthony’s been able to grow the company from a one-person show, to a team of 7 full-time developers, designers, and artists. Check out these tips from Anthony.<br /><br /><h3></h3><div><br /></div><h3>1. Design your app for retention.</h3><br />When Anthony first started TapBlaze, he initially focused on building simple, virtual simulation games. An example was his app “Good Pizza, Great Pizza”, which allowed users to virtually make and sell pizza. These early apps were interesting concepts and received a lot of attention but had a difficult time retaining customers. After the novel experience wore off, users had little reason to come back.<br /><br />For his next game, Anthony wanted to build something that would keep users engaged for months, not days. To do this, he infused 4 elements into his new match 3 puzzle game named Gummy Gush: 1) a compelling story, 2) fun challenges, 3) rewards, and 4) multiple levels that built on each other. This took a lot more time to develop, and his key metric (retention) took a little longer to measure than downloads, but the work payed off.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>“When we first launched Gummy Gush there were some players that only played for a few days, but there were others that clearly liked the art, story and puzzles and just kept playing. It was working! That was enough encouragement for us to keep improving these elements into the game. Ultimately this investment lead to much higher revenue, and even to rapid growth. Since launching in March of 2015, we have over 1,000,000 downloads.”</i></blockquote><br />Consider designing your app for retention. Retention is a key metric for successful monetization and nailing retention will lead to a much more long term, sustainable business. To learn more about practically how to retain users, check out this video from Google Developers called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rc1_oKgfelI" target="_blank">The Zen of Monetization: The Art of Retaining Users</a>”.<br /><br /><h3>2. Understand the amount of polish your app needs to succeed.</h3><br />Early last year, Anthony’s team was focused on launching Gummy Gush as quickly as possible. Anthony’s a firm believer in swiftly getting product in the hands of users to collect real user feedback, then iterate. His aggressive timeline meant making sacrifices with the polish of the app, but because he had a few artists on the team he was confident that v1 would be “good enough”.<br /><br />After launch, there was no user feedback on the polish of the game. But, a new engineering hire with a lot of game development experience urged them to invest in perfecting the look and feel of the game – standardizing UI elements, smoothing out all animation, and adding the finishing touches to the art work.<br /><br />At first, Anthony was skeptical. But, they decided to devote 2 weeks to the initiative and see how it affected their key metrics. The overhaul paid off big time. Within the first week of the update, Gummy Gush saw a 25% in average revenue per user (ARPU).<br /><br />Depending on the type of app you're building, fierce competition may have raised the bar for the amount of polish that users expect. For Anthony’s niche, a beautifully designed app built trust and increased revenue. If you’re in a highly competitive sector, it's important to assess what the industry’s threshold for aesthetic finish looks like and decide whether an investment in design app is worth making. Check out Google Play’s “<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/top?hl=en" target="_blank">Top Charts</a>” to see what the benchmark is for your category.<br /><br /><h3>3. Use analytics to prioritize your team’s next steps.</h3><br />After launching, user feedback started rolling in. Although a lot of the reviews were helpful, there were also a number of issues that were unclear. He explained,<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>“We’d receive a lot of positive and negative reviews and emails from users and didn’t know how representative the feedback were of the broader user base. Were the complaints from users who’d complain no matter what? Or were the complaints serious problems that deserved to prioritize?”</i></blockquote><br />What made it tougher was the time already spent on some of the features being criticized. For example, Anthony had invested in building an engaging introduction story that played the first time users opened the app. He even worked with a professional story writer to impart light-hearted humor in the story. His instincts knew that the story made this new app more compelling than his older apps, but did he go too far?<br /><br />His solution: test solutions with his users. The team built the smallest version of solutions to proposed problems, taking no more than 2 weeks to release. They’d then monitor key metrics to see if the change had a positive affect. For the introduction story, the team quickly built a “skip” button. After releasing it, nearly 60% of users used it, confirming that it was a real problem worth solving more deeply. <br /><br />For your app, use in-app analytics to test the individual pieces of feedback you get from users and internal hunches your team comes up with. Overdevelopment is more costly only to find out that your assumptions are wrong is much more costly that actual testing and observation.

We built a set of experiments that let anyone explore how music works. It’s called Chrome Music Lab, and you can check it out at <a href="https://g.co/musiclab">g.co/musiclab</a>.</p> <!--[Interactive video] --><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdwmtU-FkrA" style="box-shadow: 3px 10px 18px 1px #999; display: block; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left: 50px;" width="560"></iframe><br/> <p>The experiments all use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5_Audio#Web_Audio_API_and_MediaStream_Processing_API">Web Audio API</a>, an open web standard that lets you create and manipulate sound right in the browser. In Chrome Music Lab, we’re using Web Audio to create interactive drum machines, pianos, synthesizers, and more. A few experiments also let you use the microphone input in Chrome through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebRTC">WebRTC</a>. This lets you use your own voice or real sounds around you as part of the experiment.</p> <p>The web has always been a space for open collaboration. Many of these experiments use grassroots efforts such as <a href="https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js">Tone JS</a>, a framework built on top of the Web Audio API that makes it even easier to build interactive music experiences in the browser.</p> <p>We’re also providing open-source code. So if one of our experiments sparks an idea, check out <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/chrome-music-lab">our repository</a> and start building your own.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/Iw2Vis007nU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/introducing-chrome-music-lab.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-31378200582326143962016-03-10T15:21:00.001-08:002016-03-10T15:21:49.304-08:00 Coffee with Now on Tap PM Paige Dunn-RankinPosted by <a href="https://plus.google.com/+LaurenceMoroney/">Laurence Moroney</a>, Developer Advocate <p><a href="https://search.googleblog.com/2015/05/now-on-tap.html">Google Now on Tap</a> is a feature for Android phones that lets you get quick information about what you’re doing without leaving your app, simply by holding the Home button. Laurence catches up with Paige Dunn-Rankin a product manager for Now on Tap to discuss this great technology.</p> <!--[Interactive video] --><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed?v=MH_l6K-8xf0&index=29&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJP13VD_Cg8qS5g2bKWTaYx" style="box-shadow: 3px 10px 18px 1px #999; display: block; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left: 50px;" width="560"></iframe><br/> <p>It builds upon what Google Now has already done -- but making it much more personal, based on what’s on your screen right now. </p> <p>She demonstrates a chat session with a friend, where from the context of their conversation, Now on Tap can figure out the landing time for the flight he’s on, the location and reviews of the restaurant they want to attend, and even integrate neatly with calendar to create a calendar event. She also shows me how natural language processing does this -- in the conversation they didn’t talk about a calendar, just about having dinner, but Now on Tap figured out the correct time and date for them.

One of the differences between these two methods is that the MailApp’s sendEmail method doesn’t require the developer to be a Gmail user. For example, a Google Apps customer who doesn’t use Gmail, but uses Apps Script instead, can send emails through MailApp but not GmailApp. </p> <p>Starting on September 13, 2016, users with free public Google Accounts (consumers) and <a href="http://google.com/edu/products/productivity-tools">Google Apps for Education</a> and <a href="http://support.google.com/a/answer/2855120">Google Apps Free edition</a> users, will be required to have Gmail access to send messages through Apps Script’s Mail Service. Consumers can <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/answer/72198">enable Gmail on their Google account</a> after signing-in—note your Gmail will then become the primary address of your Google account. Administrators of Google Apps domains (Education and Free edition only) <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/57919">can use the Admin console to turn on Gmail</a> for their domain.</p> <p>This change does not require any updates to your code. You can continue to use MailApp as before; just make sure that you have signed up for Gmail. We realize that sometimes these changes are disruptive to our developers, but we can assure you that we put lot of care and deliberation into this process.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/Z5GThxq7XPM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/change-to-mail-service-in-apps-script.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-36090868950252744852016-03-08T09:00:00.000-08:002016-03-08T09:01:43.824-08:00 Apply now to join us and celebrate our #love4dev at #io16<i><p>Published by Mike Pegg, Head of Developer Marketing</p></i> <p>One day in June of 2006 a very special thing happened. For the first time ever, we invited a handful of developers to spend the day with us at Google celebrating what they had achieved with our Maps APIs. Our engineering team came all the way from the Sydney office to help answer questions from developers, and help them learn new ways to solve problems in the apps they were building.</p> <p>What a difference a decade makes. We’re absolutely amazed with all that developers from around the world have created and changed since that day in 2006.

Until now, you needed to implement your own instrumentation to get this information. Not anymore! Today, we’re excited to announce that we’re making all this data available right from the <a href="https://cast.google.com/publish">Google Cast Developer Console</a>.</p> <p>To check it out, log on as usual to the developer console with your developer account.

The devices tab shows the number of Cast devices that have launched your application, the sessions tab shows the number of Cast sessions of your application, and the average playback tab shows the average length of media playback time per session for your *application.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M0rL-7w29is/VtnYr1SBI0I/AAAAAAAABYI/DaRQjwjhA2c/s1600/image01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M0rL-7w29is/VtnYr1SBI0I/AAAAAAAABYI/DaRQjwjhA2c/s640/image01.png" /></a></div><i><i><p><center>The analytics page showing the tabs, graph, and tables of data</p></i></center></i> <p>Each tab’s data can be viewed in total, by country, or by sender platform. To see data for a particular country or platform, simply click the appropriate row in the table. Each tab’s data is available on a per-day basis, as well as in seven, fourteen, and twenty-eight day rolling totals. To change the aggregation range, select the desired range from the range picker at the top right.</p> <p>We hope these analytics give you insight into how your Google Cast applications are being used and enable you to see the impact of your improvements.

His team builds seamless identity experiences for users. He tells us about Google Sign-In, and the simplifications to the APIs, focusing on decoupling from the Google+ sign-in to make the user experience more streamlined.</p> <!--[Interactive video] --><iframe width="557" height="370" " frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eITMTpgVJVU?list=PLOU2XLYxmsIJP13VD_Cg8qS5g2bKWTaYx" style="box-shadow: 3px 10px 18px 1px #999; display: block; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left: 80px;" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>The landscape for users has changed over the last few years, and the user’s expectation of information that they provide for signing in is very different now. Adam shares about how his team have been engineering sign in APIs to meet these needs.</p> <p>Adam demonstrates the new APIs using the runkeeper app as an example, and how it avoids ‘cognitive overload.’</p> <p>We learn about OpenID connect, to make it super simple to use the authentication APIs with your own backend servers. It’s a much simpler experience, so that if all you want to do is sign the user in, without social, we made it simpler for you to do so.</p> <p>One question we’ve had extensively is with using iOS apps with Google Sign-In. Adam shares how Google Sign-In uses the new Safari View Controller in iOS 9 to ensure that the API will work well on iOS.</p> <p>To learn more about all these offerings, visit developers.google.com/identity.</p><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/k0poleafUnA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/coffee-with-googler-talks-identity-with.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-64955384579846643752016-03-02T15:14:00.003-08:002016-03-02T15:14:50.067-08:00 5 Simple Design Tips for Better Add-ons<i><p>Originally posted on <a href="http://googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2016/03/5-simple-design-tips-for-better-add-ons.html">Google Apps Developers Blog</a></p></i> <i><p>Posted by Ben Greve, Developer Support Specialist, Google Apps Script</p></i> <p>So you’ve started to build an add-on. Congrats! You identified a problem, figured out a solution, and wrote some code to accomplish it like a pro. Now it’s time to focus on design, to make sure your audience understands what your add-on does and how to use it.</p> <p>In this post, I will outline <b>five simple design tips</b> to help make your add-on a pleasure to use. Don’t worry if you’re not an artist – these are basic concepts that anyone can apply.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PYT4SIt2btc/VtYvZ7cMuxI/AAAAAAAABZ0/x0PUGzAxFrs/s1600/pandadoc.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PYT4SIt2btc/VtYvZ7cMuxI/AAAAAAAABZ0/x0PUGzAxFrs/s1600/pandadoc.png" /></a></div><i><p><center>Create a clear workflow for the user to follow. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pandadoc/ccienjcnenlecjjdojempdieldpgfpkk?utm_source=permalink">PandaDoc</a> by PandaDoc</p></center></i> <b><h3>1. Guide the User</b></h3> <P>Crafting a guided workflow takes the guesswork (and stress) out of using an add-on. Your user should never wonder, ‘What am I supposed to do next?’ <b>Actions, forms, text, and buttons should be designed to create a natural flow guiding the user from one step to the next</b>.</P> <P>This can be accomplished in a number of ways. Try presenting actions in a natural order: from left to right and from top to bottom (assuming LtR language; adjust as needed). You can indicate which button is the primary action by styling it using the blue <FONT FACE="Monaco">.action</font> class. You can guide the user’s behavior by limiting the actions available (sometimes referred to as ‘forcing function’). For example, actions/options with dependencies can be disabled or hidden until they should be used. Another option is to spread a workflow across several pages and require the user to complete a given page before they can proceed to the next.</P> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4-gZe5oD7Nw/VtYkAMtsy9I/AAAAAAAABY8/pz4Mt1qWCaA/s1600/remove%2Bdups.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4-gZe5oD7Nw/VtYkAMtsy9I/AAAAAAAABY8/pz4Mt1qWCaA/s640/remove%2Bdups.png" /></a></div><i><p><center>Communicate each step so the user is never lost. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-duplicates/bckmhokpcdnhhjldhhfpebhdfipmlbog?utm_source=permalink">Remove Duplicates</a> by AbleBits</p></center></i><b><h3>2. Communicate Effectively</b></h3> <p>Complex add-ons require effective communication. Simple add-ons do, too. Effective communication is necessary for your audience to understand what your add-on does and how they should use it.</p> <p>Use accessible language that anyone can understand. Don’t use complex wording if more easily digestible terminology is available. Unless your target audience has been demanding a feature to “asynchronously call an RPC with dependent proto messages,” you should <b>avoid using unnecessarily technical or jargony language.</b></p> <p>Present information when and where it’s needed. Instructions should be displayed in the context which they will be used. Actions should be clearly labeled so that users will know exactly what they do. Provide enough information so the user understands what they are doing, why they are doing it, and where they are going.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g5SGzrmdmpw/VtYkLVi-3nI/AAAAAAAABZA/kh90pf6aRVY/s1600/visualcv.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-g5SGzrmdmpw/VtYkLVi-3nI/AAAAAAAABZA/kh90pf6aRVY/s640/visualcv.png" /></a></div><i><p><center>Inform the user of the results of their actions. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/visualcv-resume-builder/hniikmldjmlpagdmekfdiddkjldheefh?utm_source=permalink">VisualCV Resume Builder</a> by VisualCV</p></center></i> <b><h3>3. Provide Feedback</b></h3> <p>Have you ever used an app where you click on a button and nothing happens? You sit there wondering: Did it work? Did it not work? Did anything happen at all? When building your add-on, don’t do this to your users. <b>Make sure that all actions have clear and immediate feedback</b>, so no one is never left wondering, “What just happened?”.</p> <p>With this in mind, there is still room for graceful design. Feedback can be subtle - it doesn’t need to shout, ‘ACTION 1 COMPLETED’! Leverage nuanced changes, such as displaying a quick message in a <a href="https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet?utm_campaign=app enginge_discussion_design_030216&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog#toast(String)">toast</a> or moving to the next step in the workflow.</p> <p>What happens if an action takes a long time to complete? Someone clicks a button and waits… and waits… and waits. A good UI will account for this scenario, too. Try using a loading graphic (i.e. a spinner or a progress bar) and for longer loading times consider including a button to cancel.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f2vAdGrdUz0/VtYkU76QJHI/AAAAAAAABZI/kdZ5x_4LSEw/s1600/custom%2Bwarning.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f2vAdGrdUz0/VtYkU76QJHI/AAAAAAAABZI/kdZ5x_4LSEw/s640/custom%2Bwarning.png" /></a></div><i><p><center>Protect the user and include safety measures.</p></center></i> <b><h3>4. Keep The User Safe</b></h3> <p>People make mistakes. It’s sad but true, and unlikely to change any time soon. Keep your users safe from themselves and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pandadoc/ccienjcnenlecjjdojempdieldpgfpkk?utm_source=permalink">design actions to have minimal risk</a>.</p> <p>The ideal solution is to remove the risk entirely. Inserting a bunch of data into a spreadsheet? Consider creating a new sheet and insert the data there. When appropriate, configure actions to add rather than replace, minimizing potential damage to existing content.</p> <p>There will be situations where avoiding risk entirely won’t be possible. In these cases, do the best you can to explicitly communicate the action’s effect so your user can make a well-informed decision. A preview or a warning of the impending changes will help ensure that the user is aware of what’s coming. And of course, provide a method to ‘undo’ when possible.</p> <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G7Dl1Q-nGjQ/VtYlBdE2e-I/AAAAAAAABZY/-S8fT3TdU1w/s1600/easy%2Baccents.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-G7Dl1Q-nGjQ/VtYlBdE2e-I/AAAAAAAABZY/-S8fT3TdU1w/s640/easy%2Baccents.png" /></a></div><i><center>Design around core functionality. <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easy-accents/njbfdnnpglelehliilonpfcbckcdhnid?utm_source=permalink">Easy Accents</a> by Daniel Baker</center></i> <b><h3>5. Keep It Simple</b></h3> <p>Each UI element in your add-on should serve a purpose; consider removing anything that doesn’t. For the best design, <b>keep it focused on functionality and trim any excess</b>.</p> <p>Using a large range of styling can actually undermine the power of the design. When a website is covered with different colors, styles, and fonts, it makes it difficult for any styling to communicate a specific meaning. Design patterns that are overly complicated or inconsistent make it difficult for users to learn what’s important and what isn’t.</p> <p>Instead, consider an app with only three text stylings: one large, one bold, and one plain. The large style is always (and only) used for headers/titles, the bold style is used for labels, and the plain style is normal body text.

It has a number of different techniques for sending messages:</p> <p><b>Single</b> devices. Each device has a unique registration token. If you want to reach that device -- for example using GCM to build a 1:1 chat application, you can do so, addressing it via that token.</p> <p>Device <b>Groups</b> allow you to bundle devices together into a group. For example, one of your users might have multiple devices -- including the very common scenario of having both a phone and a tablet. Using Device Groups in GCM, you can send a message to all of her devices, and if you desire, you can implement your app so that dismissing on one dismisses on all.</p> <p><b>Topics</b> allow you to create interest groups for your users. Once they subscribe to a topic, you can send messages to that topic, and your users will receive them. There’s no subscription limit to these, so you don’t have to worry about how many users subscribe to your topics! Some great scenarios of topics being used to improve user experience can be found in <a href="http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2015/12/google-cloud-messaging-weve-come-long.html">this blog post</a>.</p> <p>When it comes to <b>reliability</b> of messages, an internal study at Google found that the majority of notification messages (95th percentile) are delivered within 250ms to connected devices. Connectivity is impacted by many factors -- including carriers, routers and local connectivity. Indeed, in some locales it is common for people to disable mobile data for large parts of the day in order to save on bandwidth costs. In this scenario, users will <i>still</i> receive their notifications once they re-activate their data connection.</p> <p>We’ve provided a number of resources to help you to build apps using GCM. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StsyCuNGkTo">talk</a> where you are taken step by step through building an Android app and an associated server in PHP. There’s also an open source ‘GCM Playground’ on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/gcm-playground">here</a>, which provides a sample server implementation that runs on the Google Cloud Platform!</p> <p>If you want to reach iOS users, today we’re adding an API that will help you to migrate your existing infrastructure to send notifications to iOS device, with no client code changes required. With the new batch Import <a href="https://developers.google.com/instance-id/reference/server?utm_campaign=cloud platform_discussion_messaging_3//216&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog#create_registration_tokens_for_apns_tokens">API</a> you can import the APNs device tokens that you collected from your iOS audience into GCM, and immediately start sending notifications through GCM. After you import the APNs device tokens, you can also use the <a href="https://developers.google.com/instance-id?utm_campaign=cloud platform_discussion_messaging_3//216&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">InstanceID</a> API to transparently subscribe users to GCM topics, achieving efficient fan-out of notifications based on interest groups, once again with no changes required on client code.</p> <p>We’re continuing to build and innovate on this platform -- stay tuned for lots of cool new features coming soon!</p> <p>You can learn more about Google Cloud Messaging on the Developers site <a href="https://developers.google.com/cloud-messaging/?utm_campaign=cloud platform_discussion_messaging_3//216&utm_source=gdev&utm_medium=blog">here</a>, including quickstarts for Android and iOS!</p> <img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/GDBcode/~4/YoVJHUGNuj0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/> Gary Lewishttps://plus.google.com/116954523003757714329noreply@blogger.com0http://developers.googleblog.com/2016/03/google-cloud-messaging-state-of-union.htmltag:blogger.com,1999:blog-596098824972435195.post-70887594180861869462016-02-29T10:37:00.000-08:002016-02-29T10:45:38.644-08:00 Bringing Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya to Life<i><p>Posted by <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/111395306401981598462/+LarryYangGoogle">Larry Yang</a>, Senior Product Manager, Project Tango</p></i> <p>Ever been lost indoors? Us too. All the time. We brought <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/project-tango/">Project Tango</a> to Mobile World Congress, and instead of just talking about augmented reality and indoor navigation, we let attendees experience these technologies for themselves... in a museum.</p> <p>Most of us love museums, but they can be difficult to navigate. It can be hard to find the location of a painting, the story of the sculpture—and equally hard to tell your friends where you are. With Project Tango, the way we experience museums can completely change by making it easier to find what (and who) you’re seeking as well as showing you the story behind the art.</p> <p>To demonstrate this, we invited conference attendees into the <a href="http://www.museunacional.cat/en">Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya</a>, carrying Project Tango developer kits loaded with <a href="http://www.guidigo.com">GuidiGO</a>, a museum tour app, and <a href="http://glympse.com">Glympse</a>, a location-sharing app.</p> <p>With GuidiGO, attendees could view the museum’s floor plan and follow blue dots on their screens to navigate to specific pieces of art — all without relying on Wi-Fi, GPS or beacons. They could also learn more about the art by simply holding the tablet up to each work and tapping virtual tags to reveal additional information. If people lost track of their friends during their visit, they could easily share their indoor location with their friends with the Glympse app.</p> <!--[Interactive video] --><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J45EpCuD3Pw" style="box-shadow: 3px 10px 18px 1px #999; display: block; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left: 50px;" width="560"></iframe><br/> <p>We loved seeing these creative applications of Project Tango and can’t wait for people to get their hands on them with the launch of Lenovo’s consumer-ready Project Tango <a href="http://www.lenovo.com/projecttango/">smartphone</a> this summer.
