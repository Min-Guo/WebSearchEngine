Best Buy Customer Service Help Best Buy Price Match Guarantee We won't be beat on price. We'll match the product prices of key online and local competitors. The Details: At the time of sale, we price match all local retail competitors (including their online prices) and we price match products shipped from and sold by these major online retailers: Amazon.com, Bhphotovideo.com, Crutchfield.com, Dell.com, HP.com, Newegg.com, and TigerDirect.com. We match BestBuy.com prices on in-store purchases and in-store prices on BestBuy.com purchases. If we lower our price during the return and exchange period, we will match our lower price, upon request. Our Price Match Guarantee covers one price match per identical item, per customer, at the current pre-tax price available to all customers. Our Price Match Guarantee does not cover: The online prices of retailers not listed in "The Details" section. Contract cell phones sold by any online retailer. Products shipped from or sold by third-party sellers on websites. Best Buy Education and Best Buy For Business transactions. Competitors' service prices, pre-order and trade-in offers, and special daily or hourly sales. Any financing offers, bundle offers, free items, pricing errors, mail-in offers, coupon offers, items that are advertised as limited quantity, out of stock items, clearance items, open-box items, refurbished items, pre-owned items, credit card offers, gift card offers, rent/lease to own items, and items for sale Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving, whether offered by Best Buy or a competitor. Frequently Asked Questions How do I request a price match from a Best Buy retail store? When making a purchase, or during the return and exchange period, please talk to a Customer Specialist or go to the Customer Service desk for help with your price match request. Please tell us about the lower price that is still in effect that you want the Best Buy retail store to price match. Best Buy will then review and verify the price match request. How do I request a price match from BestBuy.com? When making a purchase, or during the return and exchange period, price match requests from BestBuy.com are handled via phone. Please call 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289) for a BestBuy.com price match request. Please tell us about the lower price that is still in effect that you want Best Buy to price match. Best Buy will then review and verify the price match request. BestBuy.com price match requests cannot be completed in our stores or via e-mail. Shipping/delivery charges will not be included in the price comparison. Purchases from a Smartphone application/website, BestBuy.com orders with store pickup, and orders from the kiosk inside a Best Buy store are considered BestBuy.com purchases for purposes of the Price Match Guarantee. A price match request after a purchase from BestBuy.com can be requested either by the person to whom the product was shipped, or by the person who was billed for the purchase. What is considered a local retail competitor? A local retail competitor for retail store purchases is a retail store authorized by a vendor to sell a new, factory-sealed product with a warranty and is located in the same market area (within a 25-mile radius) of your local Best Buy store. A local retail competitor for BestBuy.com purchases is a retail store authorized by a vendor to sell a new, factory-sealed product with a warranty and is located in the same market area (within a 25-mile radius) as either the billing address or the shipping address on record for the purchase. How do I show "proof" of price? The best way to show proof of price is to bring in the competitor's current ad or notify us of the website address of the designated major online retailer. We may call the competitor's retail store or check the website address of the designated major online retailer to verify the lower price and availability of the item. Does Best Buy match the prices of a Warehouse club? Yes. We do match the prices of Warehouse clubs as long as the Warehouse club is a local retail competitor, has an identical immediately available product and all other price match criteria are met. Does Best Buy match the price if it results in a price being below Best Buy's cost on a product? Yes. So long as the price match requested is on an identical immediately available product and all other price match criteria are met. Will you price match with the Best Buy site on my cell phone (m.bestbuy.com), iPhone and Android apps? Yes. M.bestbuy.com, the iPad, iPhone and Android applications have the same pricing and are treated the same as BestBuy.com. Are competitors' services eligible for price matching? No. Due to the differences in services being performed, Best Buy does not match competitors' service prices. This includes, but is not limited to, services such as delivery, installation and computer services. How does your price match policy apply to purchases made using store pickup? If you purchase an item at BestBuy.com (which includes a purchase from a Smartphone application/website, BestBuy.com orders with store pickup, and orders from the kiosk inside a Best Buy store) and if the item is offered at a lower price in the store when you pick it up, you will automatically pay the lower price How does your price match policy apply to pre-orders and backorders? If the price of an item drops at the time of shipment, you will automatically pay the lower price. Your credit card is not charged until the time of the product's shipment. How does your price match policy cover an item scheduled for delivery from BestBuy.com? If the price of an item drops at Best Buy at any time before its scheduled delivery date, we will refund 100% of the difference, including tax. To receive the lower price, you must call 1-888-BEST BUY (1-888-237-8289). Price matching cannot be processed in our stores or via e-mail. If you see a lower price at BestBuy.com or a Best Buy store near you, all conditions apply from our standard Price Match Guarantee. What if the competitor does not have the item in stock or has limited quantities of the product? Sometimes a qualifying competitor will advertise a product in ads and on its website as having limited quantities in stock. If the item is out of stock or the competitor has advertised as limited quantities of an item, it is not eligible for price matching. Likewise, if Best Buy has a product that is advertised as being limited in quantity it will not be eligible for price matching. Is the price match policy different in Puerto Rico? Yes. Best Buy Puerto Rico stores have their own store price guarantee. Is the Price Match Guarantee the same for purchases in Best Buy from stores within the store (Best Buy Mobile, Pacific Kitchen and Home, Magnolia Design Center and Magnolia Home Theater)? Yes. The Price Match Guarantee terms apply to a purchase from any of our stores within a store and to any purchase from a free standing Best Buy Mobile store. The Price Match Guarantee applies to BestBuy.com purchase but may vary from other Best Buy owned or branded websites. Please see each specific individual website for their terms and conditions. The terms of the Price Match Guarantee do not apply to purchases at Magnolia Audio/Video and Pacific Sales stores. Purchases at Best Buy Express Kiosks are treated the same as Best Buy store purchases under this policy. Does Best Buy price match "free gift with purchase" offers? No. Best Buy does not price match "free gift with purchase" orders. This includes free gift card with purchase offers. Does Best Buy price match offers with financing? Best Buy does not match competitors' financing offers, or financing offers that differ between our stores and BestBuy.com. But you can buy a product, get a price match, and still use our low or no interest financing plans on your original purchase. Best Buy also does not price match to a competitors' price that can only be received when using the competitor's credit card. Does Best Buy match competitors' trade-in value and offers on trade-in products? No. Best Buy does not match our competitors' trade-in value and offers on trade-in products. Is the Price Match Guarantee a new name for your price match policy? Yes. Until October 2014, the Price Match Guarantee was known as the Low Price Guarantee and some Best Buy marketing may still use the term Low Price Guarantee. The terms and conditions of the Price Match Guarantee apply to any promotion of the Low Price Guarantee. How does the Price Match Guarantee apply to My Best Buy® Gamers Club Unlocked purchases? My Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked members can save 20% on new video games. For purposes of the Best Buy Price Match Guarantee, Best Buy takes the discounted My Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked price into account prior to a price match request. For example, if Best Buy sells a new game for $59.99, a My Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked member will be able to buy it for $47.99. The $47.99 price is the price we would compare for price match purposes. If a competitor sells the game for $49.99, there would not be a need for a price match as the Best Buy price is lower. If a competitor sells a game for $44.99, we would match that price and sell a My Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked member the game for $44.99 with no additional discount. If Best Buy lowers our price during the return and exchange period on a My Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked purchase, we will, upon request, apply the 20% discount on the new lower price. For example, If a Gamers Club Unlocked member paid $47.99 for a new game priced at $59.99 and Best Buy lowers the price to $49.99 during the return and exchange period, we will, upon request, price match the new price with the 20% discount and sell the My Best Buy Gamers Club Unlocked member the game for $39.99. How does the Price Match Guarantee apply to coupons? Best Buy does not match competitors' coupons. Also, customers can either use a coupon or price match to a lower price, but not both. Best Buy does not allow a coupon to be used on a product that has a price match. Best Buy may run tests of the Price Match Guarantee in select locations and may amend these terms at any time.
