Accounts Help Accounts Help Accounts Managing and using Google products Use the Google bar Get to the Google products you use most, receive product notifications, manage your Google account, and more, all in one place. Ways to use the Google Bar Switch between products To switch between Google products: In the upper right hand corner, choose App launcher . From there, you can select the one you'd like to use. Note: If you don't see what you want in the menu, choose More. View, dismiss, and manage notifications From the Google bar, you can view notifications from a particular Google service, like Gmail or Drive, even when you don't have it open. View notifications Sign in to your Google Account. On the upper right hand corner, choose Notifications  . There you'll see a list of all your notifications. Dismiss notifications To dismiss notifications, follow the directions above and choose Mark all as read  . Manage notifications Sign in to your Google Account. On the upper right hand corner, choose Notifications  >Settings . Choose which notifications you want to get by checking or unchecking the box next to the product name. Customize your menu You can customize the launcher to show your favorite products at the top. To do this, drag and drop them within the menu. Add more products If you'd like to add one you don't see in the list: Sign in to your Google Account. Choose App launcher . At the bottom of the menu, choose More. Choose the Google products you want in your menu and drag to the top. Add products that aren't in the "More" menu You can also add Google products you use that don't appear in the "More" section. Sign in to your Google Account. Go to the product you would like to add and choose App launcher . Follow the onscreen instructions to add it as an app. If you don't see the app launcher on the product page, you might not be able to add that one to the App launcher right now. Note: If you're using a Google Apps account, you won't be able to customize your menu. Search within products For some services like Gmail, the Google bar will include a search box you can use to search within that service. For example, in Gmail you can use this search box to find a specific email. Sign out, switch accounts, or manage your Google Account To sign out of your account, switch accounts, or manage your account settings, select your picture on the upper right side of the screen. If you see your email address at the top instead of a photo, touch or click that. From there you can: Sign out. To sign out, choose Sign out. Switch accounts. To switch accounts, choose the picture or email address linked your other account. Manage your Google Account. To manage your account settings, choose My Account. Note: Signing out of your account from the Google bar means you'll be signed out for all Google products. For example, if you signed out of Gmail, you'll also be signed out of Calendar and Maps. Common problems I clicked on the App launcher and can't get back to Gmail If you accidentally clicked away from your inbox and end up on a different Google page, follow the instructions above to get back to Gmail using the Google bar. The products I use aren't in my notifications list The only products you'll see in your list are ones you've received notifications from already. For example, you might get YouTube notifications over email, but, if you never received a YouTube notification in the Google bar, YouTube won't show up in this list. I turned off notifications but I am still getting them Disabling notifications in the Google bar does not disable the notifications you receive from the same Google product on your phone, tablet or email. To turn off those notifications, check the settings in each product. I can't click on a product I normally use in the App launcher If you are travelling and in a country where a certain product is not supported, it will still show up in your App launcher but will be grayed out and unclickable.
