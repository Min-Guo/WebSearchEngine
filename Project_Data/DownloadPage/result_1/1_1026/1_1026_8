Kristine OtenburgDiscussion  -  2016-04-12   Hi everyone. I'm brand new to VR and have no idea how to film or how to start making one. I do have an idea for VR and want to see if anyone is already working on it. Or would anyone want to make it. ﻿Read moreShow less 1 2 comments Ben Gonshaw + 0 1 0   From your question it sounds like you want to make a 360 film. To do that you just need the right camera. For VR it's not enough to have a camera that shoots spherical video, it should also be binocular 360 video, that gives a different image to each eye so you see it in 3D, as well as being able to look around. Obviously this means you need a plugin so you can edit and output the footage properly. Shooting 360 video is much more complex than a standard shoot as you need to light and choreograph the entire scene, and not have mics/lights on show... If you want to make a truly interactive experience then you'll need to program it like a videogame, using a game engine like Unity, Unreal, CryEngine or Lumberyard.﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

Alex BillonesDiscussion  -  2016-04-12   Good day! A beginner developer here trying out VR. Currently developing a VR tour app and one idea is to provide links or gateways between images. To expound that further, say in a panorama image of a classroom, if a user sees a door, an arrow would appear indicating that the user can pull the magnet trigger so that he could "go" to that door thereby showing him/her a new location. Wondering how this could be done? I'm not familiar with Unity (if it is involved) but maybe following a guide would be a good thing to start with. Basically one that involves placing said arrow in a panorama image of an area. Any help would be greatly appreciated! :) ﻿Read moreShow less 1 10 comments Alex Billones + 0 1 0   +Bernie Roehl Thanks a bunch!﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...
