Wolbachia Wolbachia are bacteria that live within insect cells and are passed from one generation to the next through the insect’s eggs. Wolbachia is present in up to 60% of all the different species of insects around us including some mosquitoes that bite people, but not Aedes aegypti – the primary mosquito species involved in the transmission of dengue. For many years scientists have been studying Wolbachia, looking for ways to use it to potentially control the mosquitoes that spread human diseases. Wolbachia pipientis was first observed in the ovaries and testes of the mosquito Culex pipiens in the 1920s. Early studies showed that it was not a pathogen of mammals but instead a naturally occurring and harmless symbiotic bacterium of insects. Since those early studies, it has been determined that Wolbachia is extremely common in insects, with estimates suggesting that up to 60% of insect species naturally carry different strains of Wolbachia. Considering that there may be 2-5 million different insect species on the planet, Wolbachia is a very successful and pervasive insect bacterium. Site Help Copyright Intranet How Wolbachia spreads in insect populations The diagram above explains Cytoplasmic Incompatibility and how releasing a limited number of mosquitoes with Wolbachia to breed with wild mosquitoes, over a small number of generations, will result in all the mosquitoes having Wolbachia. When male mosquitoes with Wolbachia mate with female wild mosquitoes without Wolbachia, those females will have eggs but they won’t hatch. When male mosquitoes with Wolbachia mate with females that are already carrying Wolbachia, the mating will be normal and all the offspring will have Wolbachia. When female mosquitoes with Wolbachia mate with males without Wolbachia, all her offspring will have Wolbachia. Many different strains of Wolbachia Eliminate Dengue has field-tested two Wolbachia strains - wMel and wMelPop - with other Wolbachia strains in different stages of development. Each strain has a slightly different effect on the mosquito’s fitness and consequently how easily it will establish in the wild mosquito population once it is released. Wolbachia strains also differ in terms of their ability to block dengue virus inside the mosquito. Over time we hope to select strains that have a strong blocking effect on dengue virus in the mosquito and therefore prevent dengue transmission and yet are easily introduced into mosquitoes in the field and thereby provide a low-cost, long-term solution to dengue control.
