Unless they really push becoming the (or at least one of the main) go to gaming stores I don't see how that really gives them a way through to the future. ToysRUs seems to have a better selection, and Walmart and Target seem to offer better prices in physical stores. And if I'm going to order online, I can usually get a better deal on price and free shipping by going through Amazon. They need to do something to distinguish themselves.

Mercury_Glitch Mar 28, 2016 7:29 PM (in response to kamas716) Toys and games, and 'gift' products.  Gift products being all the weird non-book/magazine items you see in your BN.  Things like stationary, candles, bookends, pens, etc.  Around the 2015 holiday season stores should have set up a lot of displays of this sort of thing, many of those displays should still have some sort of display life right now.  As I'm no longer working for BN I don't have any idea of how long those displays are going to be around, but I'd suspect they aren't going anywhere any time soon.   In many ways it's sad, as Waterstones is proving that a less strictly controlled store merchandising system is actually beneficial to the overall company's bottom line, BN is plugging its ears and charging head long into areas they are weak in, like the above mentioned categories.  It might keep them going, but the road they are going down will result in them ceasing to be a bookselling company.  You'll still find books in their stores, but as can already be observed the physical footprint of the books will shrink and shrink.

They also used to be a bookstore. Sorry, people. There are no more real bookstores. It's a brave new world out there. Like Show 1 Likes(1) Actions Re: Is This the End for the Barnes & Noble NOOK? RBBrittain Apr 11, 2016 8:50 PM (in response to gb18) Actually, if you go far enough back Hastings was a record store before it was a bookstore, video store, comic book store, geek swag store, etc. It certainly has done better at reinventing itself over the years than B&N, whose biggest problem seems to be it's too stuck on books to be really good at anything else, even when it stumbles into something good on other fronts (i.e., the Nook HD & HD+ were the first Android tablets with HD access to UltraViolet movies, but Nook Video was mismanaged into an afterthought long before its closure, not to mention the whole Samsung debacle).
