Download logo files When you’re using the logo with other graphic elements, make sure you give our logo some room. The minimum size of the logo should be 16 pixels, and the empty space around the logo should be at least 150% the size of the logo itself. USAGE GUIDELINES / IT’S A BIRD, NOT A PLANE The Twitter marks represent the core values of our brand, from meaningful connections in real time to simple amplified expression. Please don’t present the marks in a manner that suggests sponsorship or endorsement by Twitter, or confuse Twitter with another brand. Always use our official and unmodified Twitter logo to represent Twitter. Don’t: Use speech bubbles or words around the logo Rotate or change the direction of the logo Animate the logo Surround the logo with other birds or creatures Change the color of the logo   Anthropomorphize the logo Add special effects to the logo Use older versions of the logo, previous logos, or any marks that may be confused with the brand OFFICIAL TWITTER COLORS / THERE’S NOTHING LIKE TRUE BLUE   TYPOGRAPHY / TO THE LETTER We believe that a word’s power is reinforced by its form. Because of this, we primarily use the Gotham font family — elegant and approachable. Gotham Narrow, in bold and book weights USING THE LOGO / LOCK IT UP   To maintain the standard of the Twitter brand, spacing between the logo and hashtags, usernames or text needs to be precise. By using the Twitter marks, you agree to follow our Terms of Service and the Twitter rules and policies.   TWEET ANATOMY / HEADS, SHOULDERS, TWEETS AND TOES Tweets are one of our most visible brand elements, so it’s important that they are presented correctly. In its most basic state, a Tweet is composed of the @username, Tweet text and timestamp. For guidance on how to display Tweets in various contexts, please see our display requirements.   TWITTER GLOSSARY / THE MORE YOU KNOW We often use specific terminology to talk about our product and experience. Remember that Tweet and Retweet must always be capitalized in both noun and verb forms. Direct Messages Direct Messages are private messages between the sender and recipient. Tweets sent over SMS become messages when they begin with “d username” to specify whom the message is for. Hashtag A hashtag (the # symbol) is used to mark keywords or topics in a Tweet. Tweets with the same hashtag are bundled together for easy subject-specific browsing, accessible by clicking the hyperlinked text. @Username The @-sign is used to call out usernames in Tweets. When a username is preceded by the @-sign, it becomes a link to a Twitter profile. Trends A trend is a topic or subject algorithmically determined to be one of the most popular on Twitter at the moment. Tweet A Tweet is a message posted via Twitter containing 140 characters or fewer. Retweet A Retweet is a Tweet from a third party that has been replicated in another user’s Twitter timeline, retaining original attribution. Retweets are often used to share news or valuable findings on Twitter. Verification A verified badge is placed next to a user’s Twitter @username to show that a legitimate source is authoring the account’s Tweets. This is sometimes used on accounts who experience identity confusion on Twitter. Twitter Ads The Twitter Ads platform is made up of Promoted Tweets, Promoted Trends and Promoted Accounts. These products enable businesses to pay to promote great content to users on the Twitter platform.   OFFICIAL ASSETS / SHARING IS CARING No matter where they appear, official Twitter assets should always function the way they do in our apps. Follow button Make it easy for users to follow a Twitter account from any webpage. Twitter Cards Use a card to display photos, videos, media, and URL previews in a way that is both beautiful and instantaneous. Tweet buttons Enable people to share your website or page by Tweeting your content to their followers. Embedded Tweets Embed any Tweet and enable readers to reply, Retweet or Like the Tweet without ever leaving your page.   TWITTER RESOURCES / HELP US HELP YOU • Twitter Help Center • Developer Terms of Use • Spam and automation • Contests on Twitter • Terms of Service • The Twitter Rules By using the Twitter marks, you agree to follow this policy as well as our Terms of Service and all Twitter rules and policies.
