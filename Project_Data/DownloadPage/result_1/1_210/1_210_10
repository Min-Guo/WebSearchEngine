For All Vendors All suppliers, manufacturers and other vendors (collectively, “Vendors”) of Barnes & Noble and its subsidiaries and affiliates must comply with the Barnes & Noble Vendor Requirements.  Please review our Vendor Requirements carefully.  By supplying Barnes & Noble and its subsidiaries and affiliates with products, Vendors agree to be bound by all Barnes & Noble Vendor Requirements, as each of the same may be amended or supplemented from time to time.  Check back periodically for updates to our Vendor Requirements.   For Vendors Who Are Also Publishers We stock over 100,000 unique book titles in our stores and over 1 million unique titles in our warehouse – more than any of our competitors or even the largest book wholesalers.  Our vast inventory contains over 50,000 publisher imprints, including small presses, university presses and independently published books. The sheer volume of books we carry demonstrates our commitment to a wide variety of publishers.  Every year we review more than 100,000 submissions from both large and small publishers from diverse backgrounds.  Our buyers review publishers’ catalogues, marketing materials and galleys or sample copies to help make their decisions.  Most of these books are added to our book database and a small order is placed for our warehouse.  This makes the title available for sale on our website and for order through our stores.  If you would like our buyers to consider your title, please see How to Submit a Book. To ensure that our vendors get their books and other products on sale in our stores and online as quickly as possible, we provide Vendor Policies and Guidelines developed according to voluntary industry standards prepared by the Book Industry Study Group (BISG). Discover Great New Writers Program  The Discover Great New Writers Program highlights the best new and undiscovered contemporary writers, and since its inception in 1990, has introduced readers to Neil Gaiman, Elizabeth Gilbert, Khaled Hosseini, Kazuo Ishiguro, Cormac McCarthy, Jodi Picoult, and Michael Pollan, among others. Publishers recommend writers making a strong literary debut, and a small group of Barnes & Noble bookseller volunteers convenes year-round to review submissions to the program and to choose a selection of new books per season for special promotion.  Annually, we recognize two of our exceptional writers with the Discover Great New Writers Award (one each for Fiction and Non-Fiction).
