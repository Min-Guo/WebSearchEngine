The New MQA Online Services Portal Is Here The Florida Department of Health’s Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) has launched a new and improved online services portal to better meet the needs of over one million licensed health care professionals and applicants in Florida. The new user-driven layout provides access to many updated features. With the improved capabilities of the new portal, licensees will experience increased functionality to manage and maintain their licenses with a personal user account. In addition to the improvements to online health care provider license applications, the online renewal process has been enhanced. Now, licensees can access all health-related licenses from one user account for a more streamlined, user-friendly renewal process. When health care professionals use the new portal for the first time, they must register and add their existing health care license(s) or application(s) to their online account.
