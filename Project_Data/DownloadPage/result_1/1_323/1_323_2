Apologies if you've already made a post on this topic. symphony-in-silver: It’s a fairly boring answer really.  I had always liked Peter Gabriel in a vague sort of way - everyone knows Sledgehammer, for example, and I bought his New Blood album when it was released and became briefly obsessed with his cover of Regina Spektor’s Apres Moi. But I was fairly snobbish about Genesis, which may be a British thing - I can’t comment on the rest of the world, but in the UK people are often quite embarrassed about admitting they like Genesis.  And you know, there are the obvious Patrick Bateman associations (Do you like Phil Collins? I’ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke…) Basically, boring answer time now, BBC4 broadcast a Genesis documentary and I watched it because there was nothing else on.  I even live-tweeted my Genesis-based snobbery.  But by the end of it I still really liked Peter Gabriel, and I was very intrigued by The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway so I had to give it a listen.  And then I fell down a prog rock shaped hole, basically. Like I say, it’s not a very interesting story. My step dad brought home a copy of “Selling England by the Pound”, I hated that frikkin thing , could not wrap my brain around it , Now I cannot get enough Tony Banks performed the keyboard solo on “The Cinema Show” on an ARP Pro Soloist Reblogged 1 month ago from symphony-in-silver 3 notes Download our Shop app. Refer friends.
