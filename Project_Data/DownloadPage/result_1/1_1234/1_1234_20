Skip to Navigation Bradley and Castaneda to reconstruct climate at old Norse settlements Raymond Bradley and Isla Castaneda, Geosciences, received a $348,218 NSF grant to analyze sediment records from Greenland’s lakes, where Vikings once settled. The work will generate new, high-resolution, quantitative records of temperature and hydrology over the past 1,500 years. Bradley, with graduate student Greg De Wet, will work in the field over the coming summer, then use newly available organic geochemical techniques in the laboratory to reconstruct past temperature and estimate changes in evaporation over time. These analyses should shed light on climate variations during the period of Norse settlement, with important implications for the broader climate dynamics of the North Atlantic. Read more Boston Globe Wood studying the impact of wildfires on air quality, environment Ezra Wood, Chemistry, has been awarded a four-year, $800,000 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant to participate in one of the largest studies to date of atmospheric chemistry in wildfires. It will focus on North America, but results should apply to many areas around the world where fires occur, such as those used to clear forests for agriculture in Indonesia and Brazil. "With climate change, forest fires are likely to be more intense and frequent," Wood points out. "And the use of fire for forest clearing is a very common practice, as is burning biomass as fuel. Overall, we will address what is being emitted, what gases and what sorts of particles, and in what quantities. We'd like to be able to help modelers predict, for example, if you burn this many acres or woodland, how many grams of compound A and particle B will be released into the atmosphere, what happens to them chemically and how long they persist." Read more Samuel Kamlarz '16 selected as 2016 Rising Researcher Senior Samuel Kamlarz, Microbiology and Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, has been selected as a 2016 Rising Researcher for his intelligent, creative, and dedicated work toward solving problems in the life sciences. For two consecutive summers, Kamlarz worked on cancer research projects as part of Tufts Medical Center’s Building Diversity in Biomedical Sciences program, where his efforts netted him an honorable mention at the program’s summer 2014 research symposium. Closer to home, his keen observations in the campus’s Klingbeil DNA Replication Laboratory resulted in uncovering a key link between mitochondrial DNA replication and differentiation of life-cycle stages in a parasite studied by the group. This discovery led to an entirely new and exciting area of research for the lab and has initiated several key collaborations. Read more Three researchers from the Polymer Science and Engineering department are among 16 recipients of Tech Development Awards from the UMass President's Office. Alfred Crosby was awarded $25,000 for a project titled "CR Diagnostics: Measuring In Vivo, Soft Tissue Mechanics," which involves the measurement of pressure in synthetic materials or biological tissue, in vivo. Kenneth Carter and doctoral student Yinyong Li received a $10,000 discretionary award for FogKicker, a new, patent-pending anti-fog solution made from natural materials. FogKicker is a biodegradable, non-toxic compound that can be coated on nearly any surface and, after drying, creates an invisible layer that prevents the formation of fog. Read more Kyle Sweeney '16 Natural Resource Conservation and Sustainable Food and Farming was awarded a post-graduate Fulbright. Sweeney will do research on drought management in the Republic of Kosovo, which is prone to droughts. Joseph S. Larson, professor emeritus of Environmental Conservation, has been reappointed by Gov. Charlie Baker to a five-year term as a member of the Massachusetts Fisheries and Wildlife Board. The board governs the policy, personnel and regulatory functions of the state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife. Read more Jennifer McDermott, Psychological and Brain Sciences, is one of eight 2016-17 Lilly Fellows for Teaching Excellence from the Institute for Teaching Excellence and Faculty Development (TEFD). The Lilly Fellowship is a competitive award program, established in 1986, that enables promising junior faculty to cultivate teaching excellence in a special yearlong collaboration. Read more Katelyn Mullen, senior Biology major, is the recipient of a Biology Undergraduate Travel Award. She will be presenting her research in a poster titled New single-copy nuclear loci for scale insect's systematics at the International Symposium of Scale Insect Studies in Catania, Sicily in June. Mullen works in the laboratory of Professor Ben Normark; he and Scott Schneider are coauthors on the abstract.
