Cookie Use Notice The BLS employs "cookies" to provide better service to our customers. We do not use cookies to collect any personally identifying information from users or to track user activities beyond our website. This means that when you visit a page on bls.gov, the web browser on your computer may download and save a small file from bls.gov so that our website can recognize your specific browser when you use bls.gov in the future. Cookies fall into two categories, based on the length of time they remain active: Session cookies last only as long as a web browser is open. Once the browser is closed, the data files on your computer are deleted. Persistent cookies last beyond a single session of browsing. These cookies allow a website to recognize a computer or user for a defined amount of time. The BLS website uses the following web measurement and customization technologies, as directed by the Office of Management and Budget's Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies (OMB M-10-22): Session cookies are used for technical purposes, such as remembering your time series selections from one page to another while using the BLS data query tools. Under the Office of Management and Budget's guidance, this qualifies as a Tier 1 use. Session cookies are used to track the number of pages you have viewed before showing you a customer satisfaction survey. Under the Office of Management and Budget's guidance, this qualifies as a Tier 1 use. Third-party session cookies are used by our analytics provider (currently Google Analytics). The analytics provider does not receive personally identifying information through these cookies and does not combine, match, or cross-reference bls.gov information with any other information. Under the Office of Management and Budget's guidance, this qualifies as a Tier 1 use. Persistent cookies are used to recognize a computer that has previously visited bls.gov. The BLS website sets persistent cookies to assess which pages are popular, how often people visit the website, and other measures. These cookies do not collect personally identifying information. Under the Office of Management and Budget's guidance, this qualifies as a Tier 2 use. How you can control website measurement and customization technologies Visitors can control aspects of website measurement and customization technologies used on bls.gov. Visitors who choose to disable these technologies will still have access to comparable information and services on bls.gov except for the data query tools, which require the use of session cookies. You can choose not to accept cookies from any website, including bls.gov, by changing the settings of your browser. You also can delete cookies stored in your browser at any time. Instructions for setting your browser security can be found at http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml.

By accessing this website, you consent to these monitoring activities. Unauthorized attempts to defeat or circumvent security features, to use the system for purposes other than those for which it was intended, to deny service, to alter, damage, or destroy information, or otherwise to interfere with the system or its operation is prohibited. Evidence of such acts may be disclosed to law enforcement authorities and result in criminal prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986, the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act of 1996, and other applicable criminal laws. Automated retrieval program (robot) activity The BLS is committed to providing data promptly and according to established schedules. Automated retrieval programs (commonly called "robots" or "bots") can cause delays and interfere with other customers' timely access to information. Therefore, excessive robot activity on BLS websites is prohibited. BLS will block robots that access the website in any way that BLS considers excessive or malicious, including robots that attempt to access or download survey information multiple times per second with resulting degradation of service to others. BLS also reserves the right to block robots that do not contain information that can be used to contact the owner. Blocking may occur in real time. NOTE: Robots using a specific IP address (for example, 146.142.xx.xx) instead of an official BLS URL (such as www.bls.gov or data.bls.gov) are at risk of not receiving data promptly at prescribed times.   Last Modified Date: April 2, 2014 Recommend this page using: Facebook Twitter LinkedIn tools Areas at a Glance Industries at a Glance Economic Releases Databases & Tables Maps calculators Inflation Location Quotient Injury And Illness help Help & Tutorials FAQs Glossary About BLS Contact Us info What's New Careers @ BLS Find It!
