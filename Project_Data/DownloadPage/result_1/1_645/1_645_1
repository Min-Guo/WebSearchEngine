Breysse Memorial Lecture Alumni Search form Search Undergraduate Program The University of Washington’s Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health is a great fit for students who love science, and who are passionate about using their scientific skills to address human health issues related to the built and natural environments.  From water quality to work place safety, environmental health majors are engaged in problem solving to keep communities safe and healthy. The program is one of only 31 in the U.S. accredited by the National Environmental Health Science & Protection Accreditation Council (EHAC). Make a Difference with Environmental Health! In the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health, students learn to identify, prevent, and control environmental factors that can threaten human health. The coursework introduces students to basic principles of environmental health regulation, environmental sampling, microbiology, epidemiology, toxicology and risk assessment. Students choose one of three interest areas: biomedical sciences, health and environmental sciences, or environmental public health practice.  The program is rigorous but flexible, allowing students to combine their interest in environmental health with preparation for graduate and professional programs such as medical school.  CURRENT STUDENT PROFILE Sara Mar Sara Mar had the opportunity to work on a project studied the effectiveness of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies in decreasing pesticide exposures among dairy workers in Washington.
