Jeffrey_MTV posted this on June 28, 2013, 9:52 AM Currently there is a 250 MB max upload size for all files.  FLAC, M4A, AIFF, MP3, MP4, WAV, M4V, MOV, GIF, JPG & PNG are our accepted file types. Wondering why your content was rejected? Head here to find out the most common reasons for content rejection. Note: As of December 2015, we have removed audio and video uploads. This will help us focus and fine tune the parts of the Artist Tool that you’ve loved and needed the most. You will still be able to upload photos, edit discography, biography, and social links. If you uploaded content previously, you will still be able to edit the metadata and/or remove it at any time.   Topic is closed for comments   Support Software by Zendesk Questions?
