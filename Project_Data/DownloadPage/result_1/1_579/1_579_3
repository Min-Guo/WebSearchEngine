Best Buy Customer Reviews This is a really nice laptop! 5 Posted by: bluedragon4680 from on 04/11/2016Overall, this is a nice large desktop replacement laptop. It has a nice screen, keyboard feels nice, 2 USB 3.0 ports, bluetooth, and a CD/DVD drive. Coupled with an Intel I3 processor, its nice and snappy too. It only has 4 gb of RAM, but it can be expanded to 8gb if you're brave and get by HP's resistance to user service. There are 2 slots. I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a nice big laptop that pretty much has all a basic consumer could want. 17 out of 17 found this review helpful. Was this review helpful? was easy to set up !!! 5 Posted by: keljo from on 04/10/2016salesman and service were excellent. HIGHLY RECOMEND this product. 15 out of 26 found this review helpful. Was this review helpful? Great budget laptop 5 Posted by: Hpfan from on 04/09/2016Upgraded from Vista, 2 gigs of ram and AMD processor. The 5th generation i3 5020u processor is top notch and handled everything I threw at it and 4 gigs of ram has been more than plenty. It handles basic gaming smoothly it also handles multiple pages in Google Chrome, while having a video playing in the background while handling multiple downloads. It's a great media laptop and Windows 10 is awesome! I totally recommend this for a budget laptop. The bundled ram and processer is more than enough to handle everyday tasks. As everyone knows for more demanding tasks spending more for extra ram and processor is common knowledge. 41 out of 50 found this review helpful. Was this review helpful?
