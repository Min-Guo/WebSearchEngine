Maggie Rose About Maggie Rose Cut from the same cloth as fiery crooners Jana Kramer, Miranda Lambert, and Carrie Underwood, country singer Maggie Rose was born Margaret Rose Durante in 1988 in Potomac, Maryland. Durante took to the stage at the age of 16, performing frequently with the B Street Band, a Bruce Springsteen cover group, before heading off to Clemson University. She left school in her sophomore year to focus on music, eventually relocating to Nashville, Tennessee on the advice of industry icon Tommy Mottola, who helped her ink a deal with Universal Republic, who released her debut single, a 2009 cover of Kings of Leon's "Use Somebody." She left the label the following year and signed with Emrose Records and released a pair of singles and an EP under her birth name before assuming the moniker Maggie Rose for the 2012 single "I Ain't Your Mama." ~ James Christopher Monger, Rovi Music Best New Videos See All 1 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose Broken 2 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose Looking Back Now 3 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose Better 4 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose I Ain't Your Mama 5 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose I Ain't Your Mama (Live) 6 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose I Ain't Your Mama (Lyric Video) Interviews & Exclusives Best New Videos See All 1 Now Playing Maggie Rose Video Maggie Rose CMT Music Awards Best Care: Maggie Rose Hear more of on Spotify Top 10 songs in 90 seconds From Spotify Hear more of on Spotify Biography See All Country Cut from the same cloth as fiery crooners Jana Kramer, Miranda Lambert, and Carrie Underwood, country singer Maggie Rose was born Margaret Rose Durante in 1988 in Potomac, Maryland.
