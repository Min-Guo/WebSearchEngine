Florida Board of Athletic Training Search Posts, Pages & FAQs: FAQs Contact Sitemap Friday, April 15th, 2016 Home Licensing Renewals Resources Meetings The Board Important Update Posted in Latest News on March 9, 2016. During the 2015 Legislative session, CS/HB 541 passed, which affects the licensure requirements for the Athletic Training profession. Effective July 1, 2016, any new applicant must submit to a background screening. Applicants must also pass the national examination to be certified by the Board of Certification. An approved Livescan service provider must be used to electronically submit a set of fingerprints to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to conduct a search for any criminal history records that may pertain to the applicant. When submitting fingerprints it is important to use the correct Originating Agency Identification (ORI) number, located on the application’s electronic fingerprinting form. If you do not provide an ORI number or if you provide an incorrect ORI number to the approved Livescan service provider, the board office will not receive your fingerprint results. The Department of Health will not be able to process an application for licensure until it has received the electronic fingerprinting results. Therefore, the applicant should contact their approved Livescan service provider to determine if they submitted their prints to the FDLE for processing. Applications should be submitted prior to submitting fingerprints in order to afford an opportunity to resolve any application deficiencies prior to the expiration of the criminal history results. Approved Livescan service providers and contact information can be found on the Livescan Service Providers List. To comply with the new law, please follow these steps: Step 1 – During the application process, you’ll be asked to read the Livescan Privacy Statement and the Confirmation of Privacy Statement Receipt Form. Every individual required to be screened must complete this form and submit it as part of their application. Step 2 – Every person required to be screened must contact a Livescan service provider (approved by FDLE) to obtain the fingerprints. Please note that each person will be required to pay a fee directly to the Livescan provider for this service. Once the individuals have completed the fingerprinting, the results will automatically be forwarded to the Board of Athletic Training Office. Please be advised of the following: Your application will remain incomplete, or expire after one year, if you do not complete the background screening process Your application will remain incomplete, or expire after one year, if you do not complete any other application deficiencies. If the background screening results show that any person has had any arrests, even if the case was dismissed, you will be required to submit supporting documentation to the Board office regarding the situation to prove the disposition in the case. Should your background screening results show that any person has been convicted of a crime that you failed to disclose on your application, you may be asked to appear at the next available meeting of the Board. You may also be asked to submit all supporting documentation pertaining to the conviction.
