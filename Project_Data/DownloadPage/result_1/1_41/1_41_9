Through our unique resources and opportunities, we work to creatively engage young people to enrich their communities. "There’s probably no way to actually measure what they have done for the community; you can’t quantify things like that." – Chris Lewis, Harlandale High School, captain "It makes me feel great knowing that one person can make a difference, and more than one is incredible." – Diana Rodriguez, Highlands High School “ I learned that nothing is ever achieved without teamwork and everything maybe just need a little bit more cooperation." Nicole Aldover, Randolph Elementary School “He [Manu Ginobili] showed us that dreams can come true by working hard.” – Lizet Rodriguez, Rogers Elementary School Connect Photo Galleries Team Up Day 2014 35 Photos Silver & Black Give Back hosted it's first ever Team Up Day, where 12 youth serving nonprofit organizations spent the day giving back as part of the Summer Team Up Challenge. 2013-2014 Team Up Challenge Champions 86 Photos About Us Who We Are Brochure News Videos Photos Contact Programs Team Up Challenge About Team Up Applications & Info Highlight Reel Scholars Media FAQ Toolkit Youth Sports Spurs Youth Basketball League Jr. Rampage Future Stars Jr. Austin Spurs Donate Events & Fundraisers Team Events Auctions Merchandise Donate Get Involved Volunteer Partners Donate Contact Copyright © 2012-2015 Silver & Black Give Back.
