Skip to main content   Posts Tagged ‘A Tribe Called Quest’ Hang Time Podcast (Episode 232) Featuring Jerry Stackhouse March 23, 2016  ·  3:32 PM ET HANG TIME HEADQUARTERS — While the Cleveland Cavaliers spend their days trying to figure out who they are, and perhaps better yet who LeBron James wants them to be, the Toronto Raptors are quietly giving chase for that No. 1 spot in the Eastern Conference standings. Their grind has been steady and a bit under the radar, since the basketball world’s focus has been locked on the Golden State Warriors and San Antonio Spurs for months now. But the Raptors seem bent on crashing the party. All-Stars Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan are trying to make sure of it. They have someone with loads of experience at their disposal in Toronto assistant coach Jerry Stackhouse, an 18-year veteran who has seen and done it all, having spent most of his life immersed in the game. If anyone can aid Lowry and DeRozan in their quest to join the league’s elite, it’s a no-nonsense veteran like Stackhouse, who never shied away from a challenge during his playing career. Stackhouse joins us on Episode 232 of The Hang Time Podcast to talk Raptors, his life and times in basketball and so much more. On a more somber note we say goodbye to friend of the show and hip-hop legend Malik “Phife Dawg” Taylor, who passed away Tuesday from complications of diabetes. Phife, a lyrical genius and noted hoops head, joined us on the bus during the Hang Time Road Trip 2 in October in Oakland. His work with A Tribe Called Quest is timeless and he will missed by many. We also want to send our prayers up for our colleague and friend Craig Sager of TNT, who is once again battling acute myeloid leukemia, an aggressive form of cancer. #SagerStrong Check out all that and more on Episode 232 of The Hang Time Podcast featuring Jerry Stackhouse.

October 14, 2015  ·  2:18 PM ET By Sekou Smith OAKLAND — The fine folks of this city and the entire Bay Area are still basking in the glow. You don’t end a 40-year title drought in a basketball-mad region and not soak it all in. And the Golden State Warriors are doing exactly that. We noticed as much on our first night of The Hang Time Road Trip, which kicked off with an interview with hip-hop legend and hoops head Phife Dawg of A Tribe Called Quest fame. Sure, he’s a New York Knicks fan transplanted on the other side of the country. But he made it clear to us that the Warriors own the Bay Area these days. Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green, Andre Iguodala and the rest of the champion Warriors remain the biggest thing going around here. We’ll see them tonight at their open practice at Oracle Arena. It promises to be a madhouse, with some of the best fans in sports crowding into the building to celebrate their team. Hey @imrickafox @sekou3000, I found our ride. #nbahangtime A video posted by Lang Whitaker (@langwhitaker) on Oct 13, 2015 at 2:06pm PDT As far as this notion that the Warriors somehow got lucky last season in the playoffs by not having to face the Los Angeles Clippers or the San Antonio Spurs? Save it. You don’t win titles at any level without a little good fortune falling your way. But these guys earned every bit of that Larry O’Brien Trophy. And they’ve earned the right to swim in the afterglow, had they chosen to do so. From what we’ve seen so far, they’ve worked their tails off to try to do it again. Their core group returns intact and, from what we’ve seen so far in the preseason, they’re already in midseason form. Steph is playing with the confidence you’d expect of a MVP and champion. Andrew Bogut has reshaped his body (#MUSCLEWATCH) and should be a force inside this season. Even with coach Steve Kerr out indefinitely to take care of his surgically repaired back, the Warriors don’t figure to miss a beat at the start of this season. They're back! Stay tuned for interviews & behind-the-scenes w/@RickFox, @SekouSmithNBA, @langwhitaker. #NBAHangTime pic.twitter.com/1wsIjLs6l1 — NBA TV (@NBATV) October 14, 2015 Any NBA season comes with surprise twists and turns, of course. So we’re not foolish enough to go making any bold predictions right now. But our track record so far is pretty good. The first day of last season’s Hang Time Road Trip was in Cleveland with LeBron James and the Cavaliers. And you know where their season ended … There’s so much going on today before get to Oracle to see the Warriors, so stay tuned on all fronts for updates and surprises. *** Keep up with us around the clock on Twitter or Instagram or Facebook (using the hashtag #NBAHangTime): Rick Fox (twitter | instagram | facebook) Sekou Smith (twitter | instagram | facebook) Lang Whitaker (twitter | instagram | facebook) Check back here for our daily (video) podcast recapping our adventures. *** Of course, this day does come with the somber news that Lamar Odom is fighting for his life in a Nevada hospital. Odom’s plight hit the NBA family hard. Kobe Bryant reportedly made his way to Odom’s bedside to visit his friend and former teammates.

Go ahead, run through your memory banks and connect those dots. It’s all there in the lyrics. Classic stuff from a true pioneer who helps us kick off the 2014-15 NBA season here on Episode 175 the Hang Time Podcast. The Five-Foot Assassin is a hoops head extraordinaire and it shows. He knows the game inside and out. And he brings a perspective few can, having been one of the hip-hop pioneers at the heart of the connection between the game and popular culture that is the norm today. We also speak to filmmaker Michael Hamilton, whose documentary “Nash” (Dec. 4) will shed light on the amazing journey of two-time MVP Steve Nash.  Dive into Episode 175 of the Hang Time Podcast featuring Phife Dawg and Michael Hamilton for more  … LISTEN HERE: http://www.nba.com/.element/mp3/2.0/sect/podcastmp3/NBA/podcast/20141028_Hangtime_Podcast.mp3 As always, we welcome your feedback.
