Read more about bookmobiles at the ALA page, National Bookmobile Day 2016 | Offices of the American Library Association.   You can also read more at Bookmobile - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, from which I borrowed the following photo, captioned: "The Perambulating Library of 1859 in Warrington, England." The paragraph accompanying the picture below explains: "The Warrington Perambulating Library, set up in 1858, was another early British mobile library. This horse-drawn van was operated by the Warrington Mechanics' Institute, which aimed to increase the lending of its books to enthusiastic local patrons." [Source: Orton, Ian (1980). An Illustrated History of Mobile Library Services in the UK with notes on traveling libraries and early public library transport. Sudbury: Branch and Mobile Libraries Group of the Library Association. ISBN 0-85365-640-1.]     I know some participants in this NOOK forum - and some authors, such as Stephen King - are bookmobile fans, because we've previously discussed those topics in multiple blog threads, discussion threads, and polls (see https://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/search.jspa?q=bookmobile). If you'd like to share your two cents about bookmobile, this is a great day to post your comments either here, at one of the threads or polls linked above, or in a new post/discussion/poll of your own. 17 Views Comments: 0 Permalink Tags: bookmobile, national library week, ala, national bookmobile day National Library Week 2016 is April 10-16.

(In the original story, a shattered pumpkin is discovered next to Ichabod Crane's abandoned hat on the morning after Crane's supposed encounter with the Horseman.) The application of the term to carved pumpkins in American English is first attested in 1834.[17] The carved pumpkin lantern's association with Halloween is recorded in the 1 November 1866 edition of the Daily News (Kingston, Ontario): “ The old time custom of keeping up Hallowe'en was not forgotten last night by the youngsters of the city. They had their maskings and their merry-makings, and perambulated the streets after dark in a way which was no doubt amusing to themselves. There was a great sacrifice of pumpkins from which to make transparent heads and face, lighted up by the unfailing two inches of tallow candle.[18] ” James Fenimore Cooper wrote a nautical novel titled The Jack O'lantern (le Feu-Follet), Or the Privateer (1842). The Jack O'lantern was the name of the ship.[19] The poet John Greenleaf Whittier, who was born in Massachusetts in 1807, wrote the poem "The Pumpkin" (1850):[20] “ Oh!—fruit loved of boyhood!—the old days recalling, When wood-grapes were purpling and brown nuts were falling! When wild, ugly faces we carved in its skin, Glaring out through the dark with a candle within! ” Agnes Carr Sage wrote, in the article, Halloween Sports and Customs" (Harper's Young People (1885):[21]: “ It is an ancient British custom to light great bonfires (Bone-fire to clear before Winter froze the ground) on Hallowe'en, and carry blazing fagots about on long poles; but in place of this, American boys delight in the funny grinning jack-o'-lanterns made of huge yellow pumpkins with a candle inside. ” In the United States, the carved pumpkin was first associated with the harvest season in general, long before it became an emblem of Halloween.[22] In 1900, an article on Thanksgiving entertaining recommended a lit jack-o'-lantern as part of the festivities.[22][23] 59 Views Comments: 0 Permalink Tags: halloween, jack-o'-lantern, headless horseman, ichabod crane, washington irving, the legend of sleepy hollow Two Ways of Doomsday Prepping, Bookworm Style Posted by Froide Oct 25, 2015 3 One: Lots of paper books + a light source Two: A pedal-powered generator plus an eReader + 104 Views Comments: 3 Permalink Tags: doomsday prepping, bookworm Two upcoming Harry Potter projects: one on stage, one on screen Posted by Froide Oct 24, 2015 0 Nancy Targlione.
