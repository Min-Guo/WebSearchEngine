Wednesday, April 13, 2016 is National Bookmobile Day in Froide's Blog Posted by Froide Apr 13, 2016 0 From ALA's Celebrate National Library Week 2016 page:   Wednesday, April 13: National Bookmobile Day, a day to recognize the contributions of our nation's bookmobiles and the dedicated professionals who make quality bookmobile outreach possible in their communities. Read more about bookmobiles at the ALA page, National Bookmobile Day 2016 | Offices of the American Library Association.   You can also read more at Bookmobile - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, from which I borrowed the following photo, captioned: "The Perambulating Library of 1859 in Warrington, England." The paragraph accompanying the picture below explains: "The Warrington Perambulating Library, set up in 1858, was another early British mobile library. This horse-drawn van was operated by the Warrington Mechanics' Institute, which aimed to increase the lending of its books to enthusiastic local patrons." [Source: Orton, Ian (1980). An Illustrated History of Mobile Library Services in the UK with notes on traveling libraries and early public library transport. Sudbury: Branch and Mobile Libraries Group of the Library Association. ISBN 0-85365-640-1.]     I know some participants in this NOOK forum - and some authors, such as Stephen King - are bookmobile fans, because we've previously discussed those topics in multiple blog threads, discussion threads, and polls (see https://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/search.jspa?q=bookmobile). If you'd like to share your two cents about bookmobile, this is a great day to post your comments either here, at one of the threads or polls linked above, or in a new post/discussion/poll of your own. 17 Views Comments: 0 Permalink Tags: bookmobile, national library week, ala, national bookmobile day More Latest Poll Loading...

[Image source: Windows 10 - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]   CNN Money says, "Windows 10 is seriously great - Jul. 28, 2015 ". I'll hold off for a bit, because I need to first back up everything and download important drivers, lest Windows 10 and my devices not play well together.   I am curious about this, though:   Has anyone yet installed Windows 10 on their computer or laptop, and afterward tried using NOOK for PC or NOOKStudy?   (FYI, this MobileRead Forums thread might also interest you:  Windows 10 - free upgrade to those with PC using Windows 7 or 8.)
