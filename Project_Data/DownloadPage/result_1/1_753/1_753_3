I just like music, I produce without presets or any of the sort and just make music from how I want it to feel. I'm pretty passionately angry towards the mainstream artists who overuse presets and generic rhythms. But this is just one thing I found to be catchy. 2016/03/30 13:43:32 +0000 Comment by Bass to Your Treble @bottom-de-bottom: You're just a guy who throws the trend comment at everyone who likes anything that is produced by mainstream productions. Its just a cute song. Get over it. And also Iphones suck dude. Why would I want one? 2016/03/30 13:41:45 +0000 Comment by Godly taco taco taco 2016/03/29 13:22:18 +0000 Comment by th4t1person people are just salty taco bell is on soundcloud the music is gud shit mang 2016/03/28 22:13:58 +0000 Comment by Matthewewew Papap @bass-to-your-treble: No, you just are a person who follows trends, *your ibutt795 rings* 2016/03/27 22:34:16 +0000 Comment by Matthewewew Papap @devoodoo: You mean scurvy. 2016/03/27 22:33:43 +0000 Comment by Matthewewew Papap @mick-erickson-499637963: Inded 2016/03/27 22:33:29 +0000 Comment by Matthewewew Papap @lamar-lavergne: I think you need help 2016/03/27 22:33:18 +0000 Comment by Matthewewew Papap Cuz this song IS scurvy. 2016/03/27 22:33:03 +0000 Comment by Matthewewew Papap @casagrande_az: It died a log time ago.
