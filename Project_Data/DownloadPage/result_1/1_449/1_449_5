The Board consists of seven members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the Senate. Five members are licensed opticians and two members are laypersons. Despite the expiration of their term, Board members continue to serve until they have been replaced. The Department of Health's Division of Medical Quality Assurance serves as the principle administrative support unit for the Board. The Board is supported by a full-time professional staff based in Tallahassee, and its regulatory functions are funded in full by fees paid by its licensees. Board members are appointed by the Governor and subject to confirmation by the Senate. Unless filling a vacancy, members of the Board generally serve two four-year terms. Despite the expiration of a term, Board members can continue to serve until they have been either replaced or reappointed or serve the maximum of ten years as governed by s. 457.103, F.S.
