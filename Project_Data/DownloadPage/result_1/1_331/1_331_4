First attempt at doing digital colors over greyscale Copics in ages.  I’m mostly happy with the result, but i can definitely see some spots that need work.

Tags: grumpybat dc dc movies makecomics April 30, 2015 24 notes Text Pre Show Commissions! Okay, so these are only exactly what they sound like, commissions done for, and before, shows, to be picked up AT said show.  I’m still working through my standing commission list, which is still going to be quite a while until i’m done with those, so, for the time being, shows are the only spots to get requested stuff :) Lists are currently being taken for Denver Comic Con, as well as Heroes Comic Con.  Four spots are available for each. That being said, here are some details for those who are interested: Single Character, full body, minimal background 11x14 illustration stock Greyscale: $250 Color: $400  – note, i don’t travel with color copics, so, if you want that option, this is it. – Other important stuff – These are pickup only, none will be shipped.  They CAN be picked up by someone other than the customer, just provide me with their info. These are for private use only, and cannot be reproduced without my permission I retain my right to reproduce the art, barring any copyright conflicts and such  We can talk about additional characters and such, but they’re not a guaranteed deal. *PRE SHOW* only.  No “at home” commission slots are available right now. Contact me at m.hetrick.art@gmail.com if you’re interested! Examples!  (note the Powergirl is a double figure piece, so there’s additional cost) April 14, 2015 17 notes Photoset Some faves from Batman Eternal #28.  I <3 Jason Todd :D  #makecomics #DC April 14, 2015 13 notes Photo Batman doodles from 2013, before i even thought i had a chance of working on a Batbook.  #batman #DC #makecomics  April 14, 2015 18 notes Archive Random Next Page Page 1 of 6 About The art and musings of a madwoman.
