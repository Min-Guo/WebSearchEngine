Maíz Apellániz1,2** 1 Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía-CSIC, Glorieta de la Astronomía s/n, 18008 Granada, Spain e-mail: jmaiz@iaa.es 2 Ramón y Cajal Fellow Received: 11 March 2010 Accepted: 20 April 2010 Abstract Context. Massive stars have high-multiplicity fractions, and many of them have still undetected components, thus hampering the study of their properties. Aims. I study a sample of massive stars with high angular resolution to better characterize their multiplicity. Methods. I observed 138 fields that include at least one massive star with AstraLux, a lucky imaging camera at the 2.2 m Calar Alto telescope. I also used observations of 3 of those fields with ACS/HRC on HST to obtain complementary information and to calibrate the AstraLux data. The results were compared with existing information from the Washington Double Star Catalog, Tycho-2, 2MASS, and other literature results. Results. I discover 16 new optical companions of massive stars, the majority of which are likely to be physically bound to their primaries. I also improve the accuracy for the separation and magnitude difference of many previously known systems. In a few cases the orbital motion is detected when comparing the new data with existing ones and constraints on the orbits are provided. Conclusions. The analysis indicate that the majority of the AstraLux detections are bound pairs. For a range of separations of 01–14´´ and magnitude differences lower than 8, I find that the multiplicity fraction for massive stars is close to 50%. When objects outside those ranges are included, the multiplicity fraction should be considerably higher. Key words: techniques: high angular resolution / surveys / astrometry / binaries: visual / stars: early-type / stars: massive * Table 3 is also available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/518/A1 ** Based on data obtained with the 2.2 m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory (CAHA). Also, some images from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) were used. The HST data were obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. © ESO, 2010 What is OpenURL? The OpenURL standard is a protocol for transmission of metadata describing the resource that you wish to access. An OpenURL link contains article metadata and directs it to the OpenURL server of your choice. The OpenURL server can provide access to the resource and also offer complementary services (specific search engine, export of references...). The OpenURL link can be generated by different means. If your librarian has set up your subscription with an OpenURL resolver, OpenURL links appear automatically on the abstract pages. You can define your own OpenURL resolver with your EDPS Account. In this case your choice will be given priority over that of your library. You can use an add-on for your browser (Firefox or I.E.) to display OpenURL links on a page (see http://www.openly.com/openurlref/). You should disable this module if you wish to use the OpenURL server that you or your library have defined. Editor-in-Chief: T. Forveille Letters Editor-in-Chief: J. Alves Managing Editor: N.
