Nathaniel_MTV posted this on August 15, 2012, 1:29 PM We love feedback, and you’re so good at it. We have recently removed audio and video uploads. This will help us focus and fine tune the parts of the Artist Tool that you’ve loved and needed the most. You will still be able to upload photos, edit discography, biography, and social links. If you uploaded content previously, it will continue to stay on your page, unless you choose to remove it.     Topic is closed for comments   Support Software by Zendesk Questions?
