But decades of aggressive timber harvesting by a succession of timber companies has left this landscape and the economy bruised and battered -- depleted inventories of timber, a network of fragile roads on steep slopes of eroding soils, and miles of sediment-clogged spawning habitat for salmon and steelhead. First Large Nonprofit-Owned Working Forest To help protect and restore these lands, in 2004 the Fund acquired the 23,780-acre Garcia River Forest, the centerpiece of one of the largest river systems on California’s north coast. As a nonprofit owner, we are protecting Garcia from conversion to vineyards or second-home development. By managing Garcia as a sustainable forest, we are able to rebuild commercial timber inventories that would support the local economy and, at the same time, help repay loans taken to acquire in the property, upgrade roads and restore stream conditions for rare and threatened species. The Nature Conservancy owns a conservation easement on the property, ensuring protection regardless of ownership. Nature Conservancy scientists helped develop the forest’s management plan, conduct forest-carbon research and monitor biodiversity conservation on the property. Keeping the land in production will generate revenue to support ongoing forest and stream restoration work and preserve jobs within the community. But these towering stands of trees are doing even more—they are also trapping carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas linked to climate change. Redwood forests store more carbon per acre than any other forest type. Sustainable forest management of Garcia River enables the storage of more than 77,000 tons of carbon emissions annually. In February 2008, Garcia became one of the first forests—and the largest—to receive verification as a source of greenhouse gas reductions under the protocols of the Climate Action Reserve, adopted by the California Air Resources Board in 2007. Garcia now provides some of the most reliable and valid carbon credits in the country to private companies and public organizations seeking to offset their greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon finance also provides significant additional support for forestry and restoration activities on the property. Why This Project Matters With the purchase of Garcia River Forest, the Fund pioneered a new approach to land conservation that balances environmental restoration and stewardship with the economic imperatives of ownership and the desire to sustain the local timber economy, the lifeblood of this region. We have demonstrated that large, understocked tracts of coastal forest can be returned to ecological and economic viability through patient, adaptive management by a non-profit organization, in partnership with private and public entities and community stakeholders. Our success at Garcia has led to additional projects, totaling more than 70,000 acres of forest owned and managed on the North Coast.  Learn more about our North Coast Forest Conservation Initiative.

Its a rare animal with skin that can absorb oxygen, allowing it to travel across land. Despite this trait, in many areas numbers of eel are declining. We recently helped the town of Groton, Connecticut save a historic property dating back to the 18th century. Although the land was saved for its historic significance, conservation often has many benefits; in this case, it also preserves habitat for eels that make their home in the waters on the property. Coastal Tailed Frog Photo by Brome McCreary This relatively small frog—the most primitive frog species in the world—is named for it's big "tail" (it's actually not a tail at all, so let's take a cue from the San Francisco Chronicle and use the term "copulatory organ"). Despite having what seems like a master evolutionary development to ensure survival of a species, the coastal tailed frog has become a species of special concern, primarily due to habitat loss. They need cold water to procreate, and when a forest is heavily logged, the water temperatures can rise. So the return of the coastal tailed frog to our Garcia River Forest is a great indication that our sustainable forest management practices are returning this ecosystem to its original healthy state.  Florida Panther Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Fearsome looking but no doubt beautiful, the Florida panther is a rare sight.  Although it's Florida's state animal, the panther is an endangered species with only around 100 left in the wild. The biggest challenge facing this cat? Habitat loss. In 2011, we completed an effort to protect Priority 1 habitat for the Florida panther. Gopher Tortoise Photo by Larry Korhnak This gopher tortoise is a resident of Kanapaha Prairie, Florida, located near Gainesville. An ecological marvel, Kanapaha Prairie is mostly freshwater marsh and open prairie, fringed with centuries-old live oak hammock. It is part of north-central Florida's vast system of wet prairies, an important stopover point for migratory birds. We worked with the communities around the prairie to save nearly 700 acres. Indiana Bat Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The Indiana bat, a federally listed endangered species, prefers to spend its days tucked under the bark of a well lit tree and hunt for insects along streams and wetlands at night. We have several projects that aim to save habitat for the Indiana bat: Our green infrastructure plan for Central Indiana mapped out ideal habitat and our Multi-Species Habitat Conservation Plan should speed up the approval of wind energy plants while protecting endangered or threatened species across the Midwest. Prairie Chicken Photo by Doug Dance There are many subspecies of prairie chickens that live throughout the American west and all equally interesting looking.  Despite having statues and festivals honoring them, populations of Greater Prairie-chickens have declined to near extinction over the past century—primarily because of the conversion of grassland to forestland and farmland. Sage Grouse Photo Bryant Olsen/Flickr Found across the western United States, the sage grouse population has declined by 90 percent over the past century and 70 percent in Wyoming. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledges it needs protection; but this bird is no small matter: Listing the sage grouse as a threatened species has big implications, especially in Wyoming where energy development—from gas to wind—is big business. So what can be done? The Fund has worked on several projects, including the protection of Cottonwood Ranches in Wyoming, that ensure the protection of sage grouse habitat. In 2012, we launched the Wyoming Sage Grouse Conservation Campaign to conserve key sage grouse habitat on working ranches statewide. San Diego Horned Lizard Photo by Ben Lowe/Flickr San Diego is known for its beautiful beaches, but there is more to this coastal ecosystem than just sand and surf: Other landscapes, such as coastal sage brush and forest habitat, are critical to maintaining the integrity of the ecosystem. A number of threatened species make their home in this ecosystem of coastal sage scrub, including  the San Diego Horned Lizard. As habitat is lost to development, numbers of this lizard continue to decline. Sand Dune Lizard Photo courtesy U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The Fund, together with the Bureau of Land Management, has protected 7,440 acres of land about 35 miles east of Roswell, New Mexico. This area is home to the sand dune lizard, which only occurs in southeastern New Mexico and is a candidate for federal listing.  The Lesser Prairie-Chicken/Sand Dune Lizard Working Group, with representatives from conservation groups, the oil and gas industry and ranchers, plus local, state and federal agencies, developed a conservation strategy for the species that was adopted by the BLM in May 2008. Timber Rattlesnake Photo by Tim Vickers, Wikimedia This face belongs to a timber rattlesnake, one of the species found in Rocky Fork, a nearly 10,000-acre tract of land that was the largest unprotected tract of land in the southern Appalachian Mountains. In 2012, after a four-year effort, the U.S. Forest Service and the Fund successfully completed the protection of the 10,000 acres of Rocky Fork. gallery_american_eel_charles_and_clint_robertson_flickr_645x430-26.jpg gallery_coastal_tailed_frog_Brome_McCreary_645x430-27.jpg gallery_florida_panther_usfws_flickr_645x4301-28.jpg gallery_gopher_tortoise_Larry_Korhnak_645x430-29.jpg gallery_indiana_bat_adam_mann_environmental_solutions_n_innovations_usfws_645x430-30.jpg gallery_prairie_chicken_doug_dance_ddancenaturephotography_645x430-31.jpg gallery_sage_grouse_Bryant_Olsen_flickr_645x430-32.jpg gallery_san_diego_horned_lizard_ben_lowe_flickr_645x4301_600x400-33.jpg gallery_sand_dune_lizard_usfws_645x430-34.jpg gallery_timber_rattlesnake_tim_vickers_wikimedia_645x430-35.jpg Learn more The Nature Conservancy State of California Coastal Conservancy California Wildlife Conservation Board NPR News: “Scientists Turn Trees into Carbon Banks CNBC.com: "Certified Forest Products: A Great Choice for the Environment" Living On Earth: “Forest Salvation” Face Of This Place: Chris Kelly Download Project Description Go Zero® ShadeFund™ Press Release: Dell Opens Eco-Learning Center at Headquarters Campus to Celebrate Earth Day.

Saving Salmon One Log At A Time In 2011, the Fund and The Nature Conservancy set out to find ways to improve and restore endangered coho salmon habitat in the Fund's Garcia River Forest. Video by The Nature Conservancy. Why Do Forests Matter? At The Conservation Fund, we believe that well-managed forests can be both economically viable and ecologically sustainable, but like all other necessary parts of our national infrastructure, they need to be invested in and maintained. That's why, since 1985, we've protected more than a million forest acres across America. Protecting and maintaining working forests, and the communities that depend on them, remains one of our top conservation priorities. "Small Change" Can Change the World At the Garcia River Forest, "small change" from customers who participate in the UPS carbon neutral shipping program—only a few cents per package on average—helps the nonprofit Conservation Fund conserve and then restore the most sensitive areas of the forest, including rivers like Garcia that snake through redwood trees large enough to drive through. Learn more about UPS's sustainability efforts. Video by UPS. Northern spotted owl in Garcia River Forest. Photo by Whitney Flanagan. At a Glance Did You Know?
