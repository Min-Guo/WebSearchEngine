Keep Wikipedia Free - Donate

Keep Wikipedia Free From Donate Jump to: navigation, search From Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales From Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world. Commerce is fine. Advertising is not evil. But it doesn't belong here. Not in Wikipedia. Wikipedia is something special. It is like a library or a public park. It is like a temple for the mind. It is a place we can all go to think, to learn, to share our knowledge with others. When I founded Wikipedia, I could have made it into a for-profit company with advertising banners, but I decided to do something different. We’ve worked hard over the years to keep it lean and tight. We fulfill our mission efficiently. If everyone reading this donated, our fundraiser would be done within an hour. But not everyone can or will donate. And that's fine. Each year just enough people decide to give. This year, please consider making a donation of €5, €20, €50 or whatever you can to protect and sustain Wikipedia. Thanks, Jimmy Wales Wikipedia Founder “ Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet has free access to the sum of all human knowledge. ” —Jimmy Wales, Founder of Wikipedia It appears that you do not have JavaScript enabled, or your browser does not support it.

Wikipedia is one of the top 10 websites in the world, and it runs on a fraction of what other top websites spend. People and Projects: The other top websites have thousands of employees.
