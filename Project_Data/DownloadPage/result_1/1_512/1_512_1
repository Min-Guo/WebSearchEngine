It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Ray Edwards, author of Writing Riches and MoneyWords. He's host of The Ray Edwards Show. His latest book is called How to Write Copy That Sells: The Step-by-Step System for More Sales, to More Customers, More Often.</p> <p>Ray will explore how to craft written and spoken words that sell.</p> <p>You'll discover why marketers should care about creating persuasive content.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes, and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, or SoundCloud.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> The Art of Persuasion<br /> Ray's copywriting journey</p> <p>In 1974, at age 9, Ray saw his first direct-response copy at his grandparents' house in Pineville, Kentucky. His grandmother loved to read Weekly World News and The National Enquirer, and Ray's favorite part of those tabloids was the fascinating, full-page articles that were peppered with information about books and courses that were available for purchase.</p> <p>Those stories had headlines like, "Turn Your Mind Into a Mental Magnet That Attracts Friends, Power, Love, and Money" and "How Modern Chinese Medicine Helps Burn Disease Out of Your Body, Using Nothing More Than the Palm of Your Hand." Ray later learned these were not articles; they were full-page ads written by Eugene Schwartz, who was "a genius with direct-response copy."</p> <p>During his career in radio, Ray studied direct-response copywriting and marketing, and used them as his secret weapon in the business. While others were cranking out commercials and ad copy to fill 30- or 60-second spots, Ray wanted to get money into advertisers' businesses. That way they would keep doing business with the station and he could keep his job.</p> <p>In the early 2000s, radio started changing because of the Internet. People could take their favorite songs with them, which eliminated the things that annoy people about radio stations: static, commercials, and DJs.</p> <p>Ray recalls paying $1,200 to go to a group meeting at Seth Godin's office in New York. (This was before Seth was as big as he is now, but after he had written Permission Marketing and Unleashing the Ideavirus.) Ray figured Seth could offer "marketing wizardry" about how to fix the radio stations, but Seth's advice to Ray was to figure out what to do after he was out of the radio broadcasting industry.</p> <p>Ray realized everything he'd learned about marketing, persuasion, and selling in an entertaining and palatable way would transfer to the Internet. He hung out his shingle and has been working as an Internet copywriter sin... http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/the-art-of-persuasion-how-to-craft-words-that-sell-with-ray-edwards/feed/ 4 Do your words sell?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Michael Hyatt and Brian Clark. Michael is author of Platform and co-author of the new book, Living Forward: A Proven Plan to Stop Drifting and Get the Life You Want. He's also an avid blogger at MichaelHyatt.com and host of the This Is Your Life podcast. Brian is CEO of Rainmaker Digital, founder of Copyblogger, host of the Unemployable podcast, and evangelist for the Rainmaker Platform.</p> <p>Back in May 2014, I had Mark Schaefer and Tim McDonald (who was with Huffington Post) on the show to talk about the trend of big blogs shutting down their comments. This was spurred by a controversial post from Copyblogger entitled, "Why We’re Removing Comments on Copyblogger" from March 2014. In January 2015, Michael Hyatt published, "I’ve Pulled Comments from My Blog-Here’s Why."</p> <p>Michael and Brian will explore why the initial decision to remove comments was made and why those comments are now back.</p> <p>You'll also discover tips for how to grow your email list.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or SoundCloud.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Blog Comments Revisited<br /> Why Brian shut down comments</p> <p>Brian starts by saying he is not the one who made the decision to shut down or bring back blog comments. He left that up to his editorial team.</p> <p>On Copyblogger, a lot of the article feedback shifted to social media, while the product development feedback had moved over to their customer base. As you mature as a company, you really start listening to your existing customers, as opposed to those "out in the wild," Brian explains. At the time, they had 150,000 customers and their strategy was to pay more attention to them.</p> <p>Part of the decision to remove comments (not discussed in the post by Sonia Simone, who ultimately made the decision with input from the editorial team) was a situation Brian calls the six-month class of current commenters.</p> <p>When you publish a marketing blog, other marketers use commenting as a traffic strategy. You'd have six months of the same people showing up, leaving comments: some stupid, some thoughtful. Then they'd move on and a new group of people would come into the comments.</p> <p>The practical reasons for removing comments were the shift to social and to eliminate spam. It's a big deal to moderate comments and have the editorial team spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out whether something is spam or legitimate.</p> http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/blog-comments-revisited-why-major-bloggers-are-turning-comments-back-on-michael-hyatt-brian-clark/feed/ 14 Do you have comments enabled on your blog?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Rick Mulready, the host of the Art of Paid Traffic podcast. He's a Facebook Ads coach and has numerous courses on Facebook advertising, including the FB ADvantage.</p> <p>Rick will explore what's changed with Facebook ads and share new strategies that work.</p> <p>You'll discover best practices for video ads, carousel ads, and more.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or SoundCloud.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Facebook Ads Strategy<br /> Rick's story</p> <p>Rick spent 12 years in the corporate online advertising space, working with big companies like AOL, Yahoo, Funny or Die, and Vibrant Media. He did everything from banner and video ads to search and text advertising. Rick got into Facebook ads around 2010, while still in the corporate world.</p> <p>This was when Facebook was making a name for itself as a social platform, when small businesses could post on their pages and people would see it, and when Facebook started to allow business to advertise.</p> <p>Rick loved Facebook advertising. He saw the power in it, and taught himself as much as he could. He started running campaigns for entrepreneur friends while still in corporate, and the rest is history. Rick left his job at the end of 2012 and has been specializing in Facebook ads ever since.</p> <p>For the first couple of years, Rick focused on social media in general. He hosted the Inside Social Media podcast, where he interviewed the heads of social media from some of the biggest brands around the world. That was great, yet Rick still gravitated toward the Facebook ad side.</p> <p>In January 2015, Rick started the Art of Paid Traffic podcast, where he covers Facebook advertising and everything else to do with paid traffic such as YouTube ads, copywriting, landing pages, metrics, analytics, and so on. It's a combination of case studies, interviews with experts, and solo shows.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn why only big businesses could really utilize Facebook ads in 2010.</p> <p>How Facebook Ads has evolved</p> <p>A lot has changed in Facebook advertising – such as targeting – over the past year or so, Rick says. For instance, you can upload your email list and create a targeted audience out of them. Also, you can retarget people coming to your website or a landing page.</p> <p>When most people think of targeting, they think of interest targeting, http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-ads-strategy-how-marketers-need-to-alter-their-techniques/feed/ 13 Do you use Facebook ads?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Kim Garst, author of Will the Real You Please Stand Up: Show Up, Be Authentic, and Prosper in Social Media. Her agency Boom! Social helps businesses understand the selling side of social media.

So, while in a pedicab heading over to that night's Social Media Marketing World networking event, she did a quick scope with Donna Moritz.</p> <p>Kim's second Periscope came about a month later, when she was covering an event. One of the keynotes was Ashton Kutcher and she decided to open up her phone, broadcast the keynote, and see what happened. Although Kim had very little Periscope experience and a nearly nonexistent audience on the platform, a few people tuned in and left comments.</p> <p>Her third Periscope was the most eye-opening because that's when Kim realized she could use the platform for business. She had Syed Balkhi on a webinar and decided to live broadcast it to her Periscope audience by putting her phone on her computer screen and holding a mic up to the sound source.</p> <p>Kim shares that with no prep, she simply opened up her phone, typed in the webinar title, and invited people to tune in. More than 200 people watched the broadcast.</p> <p>Kim soon realized Periscope could be an amazing medium – not just to deliver content, but also to connect with people.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why Kim believes live-streaming is the beginning of Web 3.0.</p> <p>Periscope strategy</p> <p>Kim shares that one strategy she's capitalized on is leveraging Periscope to create multiple pieces of content. She comes up with one or two blog topics for the week, writes down bullet points and research she wants to reference, and then gets on Periscope and speaks her blog content.</p> <p>For example, if the topic is 10 Ways to Do X, http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/periscope-how-your-business-can-benefit-from-live-video-with-kim-garst/feed/ 4 Do you broadcast on Periscope?

At 14 years old, he started working for his dad bagging ice for $2 an hour and by his third day on the job was plotting how to open 4,000 wine stores.</p> <p>Although a lot of people think Wine Library TV grew his business, Gary clarifies that he'd been in business for over a decade and built a $50 million+ operation before he started Wine Library TV and talking about marketing.</p> <p>Gary launched Wine Library TV on February 1, 2006, which was less than a year after YouTube had been created. He says that while the show didn't really pop until the summer of 2007, he felt there were enough comments to make it worthwhile. He notes that Ze Frank and Rocketboom were also making some noise around the same time.</p> <p>Gary's patience paid off and when he ended up on the Conan O'Brien Show, Lifehacker, TechCrunch, and Diggnation, everything exploded.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how and when Gary discovered he was good at being a personality.</p> <p>The start of #AskGaryVee</p> <p>During the summer of 2014, D Rock (David Rock) emailed Gary, asking to make a film about him. Gary agreed and before the film even aired, Gary asked David to work for him full time doing video content.</p> <p>Then on a random day a year and a half ago, Gary invited David and Steve Unwin from his editorial team into his office to shoot the first episode of #AskGaryVee, in which Gary answered random questions people asked him on Twitter.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76d0lQiCqNI</p> <p>When asked how the format for the show came about, Gary shares that he felt his keynotes were stagnating because he was telling the same story over and over.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Mari Smith, the world's leading Facebook marketing expert. She co-authored Facebook Marketing: An Hour a Day and is author of The New Relationship Marketing.

When you go live, the video goes out in the notifications and in the news feed and gets great organic reach.</p> <p>Mari believes Facebook Live video is great for marketers because it gives the ability to create a intimate, authentic connection with your audience. It humanizes and personalizes your brand.</p> <p>She clarifies that you don't need to download anything extra to stream with Facebook Live on your profile; it's part of the Facebook iOS app. Mari points out that Live is different from Facebook Mentions, which is only available to verified Facebook users.</p> <p>At the time this episode was recorded, all iPhone users had Facebook Live on their personal profiles in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, New Zealand, Japan, and most English-speaking countries. On February 26, 2016, Facebook announced they'd opened Live to more countries, as well as Android users.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear about Mike's first experience with using Facebook Live.</p> <p>Facebook Live for business</p> <p>Mari says when you use Facebook Live through your personal profile, you get to choose the audience. You can broadcast to the public, friends only, a specific friends list, or just a few friends. Since one of the keys from a business perspective is to broadcast live and then share it to your page, you want to go with a public broadcast. Then once it's been shared to your page, you can boost the post to reach a wider audience.</p> <p>When asked for examples of people using Live, Mari shares that Guy Kawasaki uses Live regularly from his page to show equipment or where he is and what he's doing. She also points to Robert Scoble, http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/feed/ 34 Have you tried Facebook Live video broadcasting?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview social tools expert Ian Anderson Gray. Ian blogs about social tools at Seriously Social, which can be found at iag.me.

Then, about five or six years ago, he became interested in social media and started blogging at Seriously Social.</p> <p>He shares that he was most interested in the tech side of social media. Specifically how tools could help him be more efficient and productive. That's when he began writing on social media tools. From there, Ian has moved on to consulting and speaking.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover Ian's original career path.</p> <p>Social Sharing Tools</p> <p>Ian starts off with missinglettr, a relatively new tool he's using as a drip-feed marketing system for Twitter. He explains that it extracts images, titles, and text excerpts from your latest blog posts, and then posts them through your Twitter account for up to a year.</p> <p>Simply connect missinglettr with your RSS feed, Ian says, and whenever you have a new blog post, you're notified to go into missinglettr and review the pieces extracted from that post. Select the ones you like and edit them and you'll have a whole year's worth of content from a single blog post. For example, in a list post, Ian explains, missinglettr will likely extract the title of each section, as well as your logo, some text quotes, and images.</p> <p>He says Missinglettr offers a free plan that doesn't include extracting images, and quotes premium plans starting at $15 a month.</p> <p>To keep up with the latest articles from his favorite authors and blogs, Ian uses Feedly. He explains how to take things a step further by connecting it with Buffer and IFTTT (If This Then That).</p> <p>After you add both your Feedly and Buffer accounts to IFTTT, you can create a recipe that says IF you save an article for later in Feedly, THEN it will be added it to your Buffer queue for sharing to your Twitter followers.</p> http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/16-twitter-tools-for-social-media-marketers/feed/ 16 Do you use Twitter in your social media marketing?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Kim Walsh-Phillips, CEO of Elite Digital Group, a direct response social agency. She's also a columnist for Entrepreneur Magazine. Her brand-new book, co-authored with Dan Kennedy, is the No B.S.

Although she would get clients into the newspaper and throw great events, she was unable to show a return on investment. So when it came time for clients to renew, they would cancel. Kim spent much of her time going to networking events, meeting people, and trying to sign new clients. She knew she had to do something differently.</p> <p>In 2010, a friend gave her Dan Kennedy's original book, the No B.S. Guide to Direct Marketing. Because social is a channel just like direct mail, television, and radio, applying Dan's principles to social media worked.</p> <p>She could show clients how much money came from every dollar they spent, and was able to keep their accounts,which is something she was unable to do before.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what Kim had to do one time to make payroll.</p> <p>Direct response social media</p> <p>Kim explains that people use social media to have conversations, not to read a brochure. Direct response is a marketing tactic used to get a click-through, an opt-in, or drive a purchase.</p> <p>She shares that before social media, direct response tactics were used in direct mail, infomercials, print advertising, and even email.</p> <p>Kim says that when you tie social media and direct response together, you have conversations with people to create a direct result that is measured.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why Kim believes email and social media marketing don't carry a lot of direct response messaging.</p> <p>How marketers can tap into social</p> <p>Facebook is a cocktail party, Kim explains, whereas Google is a shopping mall (people are there searching for products, programs, and services). If you're going to interrupt their cocktail party with an "excuse me," you have to offer enough value that someone is willing to turn away from their best friend to pay attention to you.</p> <p>To engage fans in this non-disruptive way, http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/nurturing-leads-with-social-kim-walsh-phillips/feed/ 2 Do you engage with your customers and prospects on social media?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Carlos Gil, the head of social media marketing at BMC Software and co-host of the Social 545 podcast.

He decided as a marketer, he needed to get on Snapchat, because the Millennials who were using it would soon be adults.</p> <p>He says he spent most of 2014 getting to know the platform and creating content. Over the course of a solid year, Snapchat became his go-to social network.</p> <p>Carlos began seeing more of his friends within the social media marketing community on the platform. What sold him on Snapchat over other networks like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, was the engagement. Snapchat essentially forces your audience to come back and watch your content within a 24-hour period, because if they don't see it, it goes away.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn about Snapchat's previous reputation.</p> <p>Why marketers and entrepreneurs should be on Snapchat</p> <p>Last February, we had Gary Vaynerchuk and Shaun McBride (aka Shonduras) on the podcast to discuss Snapchat. A year later, it looks like Snapchat is about to explode.</p> <p>Snapchat has more than 200 million monthly active users and its audience continues to grow and mature. Snapchat is very transparent when it comes to their demographics, and reports that 77% of their user base is above the age of 18.</p> <p>Carlos thinks people are consuming so much content on Snapchat because it puts what you love about Twitter (the micro-content aspect) and what you love about YouTube (pressing a Play button to sit back and watch content) into a single app. You can go in and press a button to see what anyone you're following has done in the last day.</p> <p>He explains that when you publish content on Snapchat, it's available for 24 hours, which forces your network to come back and watch it. The messaging feature on Snapchat, which works almost like a text message, allows you to send content directly to your friends. Then, you can specify how long you want that content to be seen, http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/snapchat-content-strategy-how-marketers-can-win-with-snapchat/feed/ 13 Are you on Snapchat?

He shares that people reached out to him and thanked him for helping them in their careers, and he says that feeling was different from anything he experienced in the world of architecture.</p> <p>Pat talks about what he did and didn't like about working as an architect, and how the long-term process of breaking a giant project down into chunks helped him when he started in entrepreneurship. He says the process of working hard on a building, planning ahead, and not knowing what it will be like until people are actually using it all translate to building and launching product.</p> <p>Architects and entrepreneurs go through similar processes, Pat says. Each of them are building a solution for a client's problem. As you build it, you make changes, you pivot and you learn as you go. To be successful in any business you need to learn how to adapt and solve other people's problems.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what software skill Pat used in architecture that he still uses in business.</p> <p>Why Pat wrote a book about the pre-launch phase</p> <p>In addition to Pat's weekly Smart Passive Income podcast, he does a show called AskPat, during which he answers a voice mail question submitted from his audience via SpeakPipe.</p> <p>One of the most common questions asked is "How do I know if this idea I am working on is worth spending the time?" He tried to answer this question on both shows and found there wasn't enough time for him to cover the topic.</p> <p>The topic was validated through an audience survey (Pat uses SurveyMonkey) in early 2015, when he segmented the people who said they had yet to start a business. By far, their number one concern was not wanting to waste time on something that might not be successful.</p> Do you have a great idea for a business? Is there a new product you want to create? To discover how to improve your chances for success, I interview Pat Flynn.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Christopher Penn, the VP of Marketing Technology at Shift Communications.

Chris adds that it's a lot more reliable than manually managing tags for each page.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how Tag Manager can speed up your site.</p> <p>The importance of Tag Manager</p> <p>In addition to speed, Chris believes reliability is a big reason to use Tag Manager. If you have a lot of different webpages, websites or use marketing automation services that have their own landing pages, forgetting to put tags on all those pages will ruin your analytics, Christopher says. As long as you use the bucket on every page, you're covered.</p> <p>The flexibility of Google Tag Manager, is really important. It allows you specify that you want some tags on some pages, other tags on all pages and certain conditions to be met for still others. Chris shares an example.</p> <p>Say you are promoting an event, like Social Media Marketing World, and you want to put a tag on the event page for people who have visited the page, but haven't yet purchased a ticket. If you've haphazardly put tags everywhere, you could lose track of what page your tag needs to be on. With Tag Manager, you can specify it to fire the tag if the url has "smmw16" in it.</p> <p>Tag Manager is also important for social media marketers who don't have control over website ... Do you use tracking codes on your website? Have you heard of Google Tag Manager? To discover what Google Tag Manager is and how to use it, I interview Christopher Penn.

His company Convince & Convert helps major brands with their social media and content marketing, and they increasingly get involved in issues with customers.</p> <p>It's not just about being proactive and doing marketing, Jay says. You have to be just as good, if not better, at reactive customer service. Jay found even organizations with a lot of resources were befuddled by everything related to digital customer service and experience in the modern world.</p> <p>Jay shares how conducting a tremendous amount of research with Tom Webster from Edison Research changed the focus of his book.</p> <p>Last year at Social Media Marketing World, Jay did his "Hug Your Haters" presentation for the first time. Although he has taken the Youtility concept all over the world, Jay says the Hug Your Haters book is the best thing he's ever done and the speech is the best speech he has ever given.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what Tom Webster said he liked about Hug Your Haters in the forward to the book.</p> <p>What are haters and why do people hate</p> <p>Jay refers to anybody who complains about a business either off stage or on stage as a hater. An off-stage hater is somebody who complains in private: on telephone and email. An on-stage hater is somebody who complains in public: social media, review sites, discussion boards and forums.</p> <p>He shares that historically and even currently, the majority of people complain off stage but that the pendulum is swinging the other way because it's much easier to reach out to a brand on Facebook, Twitter or beyond than it is to send an email or wait on hold.</p> <p>When people complain off stage, they almost always want an answer. They have a problem they want to be fixed, and 90% of the time they expect companies to respond. When people complain on stage, Does your business respond to customers via social media? Are you prepared to deal with upset customers? To discover how to turn unhappy customers into happy fans, I interview Jay Baer.

Technology didn't empower us to do things like shoot and post videos immediately, stream online or do podcasts. Back then, even sharing images was pretty difficult.</p> <p>He shares that for him, blogging started to evolve when social media platforms for smaller forms of text-based publishing turned up, like Twitter. Then images and video became easier to publish and share.</p> <p>Mitch says things became very different with Twitter and Facebook status updates. The updates gave people who were writing long-form articles the ability to publish stream of consciousness–style instead. He talks about how this change created a space for platforms like Huffington Post to progress and become more popular with people who wanted to write.</p> <p>While Mitch still looks at his blog as a place for a writer to write, he says it's no longer the primary place for his content. He talks about putting content in places such as Medium, LinkedIn Publisher, Facebook Notes and Harvard Business Review where it might find different audiences. He explains why he'd rather publish directly on these other sites and use them as his distribution platform.</p> <p>Mark thinks blogging will be dead when reading is dead and that there will always be a place for long-form content. He explains why things like podcasts and streaming video are taking some readership away and how smartphones play into that.</p> <p>Mark says that Mitch is onto something in saying what's changing most drastically is not what we're doing, but where. He points out that there are cataclysmic changes in how content is published and consumed and offers the example of Facebook Notes, which encourages people to blog on Facebook.</p> Wondering what the future is for blogs?

Natalie says she was looking for a social media site where she could post her content and reach more people over time. When she noticed older items getting repinned, she decided Pinterest had the content value-over-time effect she was looking for.</p> <p>A year and a half ago, Natalie started deep-diving into Pinterest and says she currently has 1.3 million fans on Facebook and fewer than 50,000 followers on Pinterest (it's one of her smallest social networks). She goes on to explain why the lower Pinterest follower count doesn't matter when it comes to content shares. She also points out that Pinterest comes up in Google search, which is a huge benefit.</p> <p>When Natalie noticed she was getting a lot of website traffic from Pinterest, she decided to figure out how to use Pinterest to help with her content in other places.</p> <p>Natalie explains how she tested her tactic, which she calls the Pinfinity concept, Are you active on Pinterest?

He was a marketer at a direct-response company that sold high-end collectibles. One year around Christmas, he got a phone call that should have gone to customer service. A woman was upset because a gift she ordered for Christmas had not yet arrived. Dan shares how he made sure Christmas wasn't going to be ruined on his watch.</p> <p>Dan says taking an extra moment to think about something from the customer's point of view usually will make you a much better marketer. He talks about his roles at Discover and winning the JD Power Award for best customer experience, taking it away from AmEx.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Dan got started in social media.</p> <p>How customer service fits into social media marketing</p> <p>Studies from Gartner say that as soon as next year, more than 85% of companies will have to compete on customer experience. It's getting too expensive for industries to compete on price, so they need to differentiate themselves by customer experience.</p> <p>Dan says when you interact with customers on a one-to-one basis on social media, it makes them more loyal. Loyal customers spend more with you, stay with you longer and tell their friends about you.</p> <p>All of these elements result in improved KPIs (key performance indicators), which is what marketers care about.</p> <p>Forrester's Customer Service Index is a pretty good indicator of how well large companies are doing, Dan explains. Over the course of many years, Forrester looked at the stock prices of the top- and bottom-performing public companies. The top-performing companies do well in customer experience, while the poor performers in customer experience are at the bottom. There’s a direct link between customer experience and profitability.</p> Does your business have a social customer service plan?

Since I drained the battery playing with my new iPhone, it was charging in another room when a text message came at 4:12 PM: “We have a bit of an emergency. Our Facebook page is missing. You around?” I had missed the text.</p> <p>The phone rang 12 minutes later, and my wife picked it up. Our community manager Erik Fisher was calling to tell me what happened. Between the time he texted me and when he called, Erik poked around Facebook and confirmed it. The Social Media Examiner Facebook page had disappeared.</p> <p>And I mean it was really gone. I even received a notification that my personal profile was incomplete because it didn’t list where I worked.</p> <p>I checked to see if I could view the page on mobile or on my laptop, if I could get into the admin side of the page and if the Facebook Fan widget appeared on our site. The answer for everything: no.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn why it's important to instruct your team to call you in an emergency situation.</p> <p>First thoughts</p> <p>Initially, I thought we’d been hacked. Then I recalled how after I did the Chalene Johnson story we'd taken all the steps necessary to secure the accounts of all of our staff.</p> <p>We secured email with 2-step authentication to our corporate Gmail accounts and we turned on Facebook Login Approvals. Plus, we recently completed a security audit of everyone on our team, and have a master document of who has administrative access to what. These are all steps you can take to secure your business accounts, and you can hear more about how to implement them in the podcast.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear our thoughts about "what if" the page was gone permanently.</p> <p>First steps</p> <p>After I got off the phone with Erik, everything around me faded into the background. Within minutes I posted the following to friends only:</p> <p>Ok friends, our Social Media Examiner Facebook page has fully disappeared from existence? Anyone have any suggestions on what to do?</p> <p>Posted by Michael Stelzner on Sunday, November 8, 2015</p> <p> </p> <p>Initially, I decided to share it only to friends just in case there was something nefarious going on.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Daniel Lemin, the founder of One Good Brand. He is also a strategist for Convince & Convert, and author of the brand-new book, Manipurated.</p> <p>Dan will explore online reviews and how to deal with bad and fraudulent reviews.</p> <p>You'll discover why online reviews are so important.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Online Reviews<br /> Dan's backstory</p> <p>Dan started his online career with Google's corporate marketing team and saw the emergence of black hat SEO (search engine optimization). He explains the distinction between white hat (good) and black hat (bad) SEO, and talks about link farms as an example of black hat tactics.</p> <p>Google came to love Yelp's fresh content and Dan says that's how the rating and review platforms attracted shadowy SEO characters. They saw the opportunity to continue "tricking" consumers through new platforms.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why the owners of small- and medium-sized businesses need to know the dynamics of the SEO industry.</p> <p>Why reviews are important</p> <p>Dan shares that nearly 90% of consumers say they trust reviews as much as they trust their friends and family. Since so many people make decisions based on online reviews, the vast majority of a business's prospective customers are filtering through review sites.</p> <p>Since Google favors this type of content, reviews are a new SEO tactic, and that's why site owners are adding some type of rating and review component. For instance, a lot of hospitality businesses like Starwood Hotels have added reviews to their websites.</p> <p>He says one review will not necessarily make or break a business, but cautions that the presence of the review industry can make or break small businesses, because they don't have all the tools and techniques a large company like Chipotle might have.</p> <p>When asked which review sites matter most, Dan explains his research found it really depends on the business category. For example, Gondola Adventures in Newport Beach, which is in a super-specialized industry, says Yelp matters, but TripAdvisor is even more important.</p> <p>Dan says companies can track reviews manually by going to each review site, but it's very time-consuming. To help, there's a whole cottage industry of companies such as ReviewTrackers and ReviewPush that do review tracking for businesses.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn how much traffic Yelp gets from Google.</p> <p>The purpose of fake reviews</p> <p>Dan shares that there are different layers to the purpose of fake reviews.</p> <p>He first discusses fake positive reviews and says that several weeks ago, Amazon filed an unprecedented lawsuit against 1,100 people. They accused anonymous people on Fiverr of selling reviews ... Do people review your business online? Ever receive negative or fraudulent reviews?

Late in 2006, Google purchased YouTube and it became a lot easier to find something on YouTube through Google. Derral realized it was a great way for small shops to share their message and get easy ranking and visibility.</p> <p>Derral shares how a video that cost $99 to make in 2006 received over 385,000 views on YouTube and has sold more couches for a furniture store than any of their other advertising.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, Derral started doing his own videos to help clients get answers to common questions. He created a plan of execution, tried to figure out the best trending videos to make and so on. His goal was to get 10,000 subscribers and a million views in that first year.

He cautions that if you have 80, 10 or even 3 things you want to accomplish, then it's never going to work. You need narrow it down to one reason to make the ad. Then everything else will benefit from it.</p> Do you post videos on YouTube? Want to know what makes a video ad successful? To discover how YouTube video ads work, I interview Derral Eves.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Nathan Chan, the publisher of Foundr magazine, a digital publication designed to help entrepreneurs succeed. He's also host of the Foundr podcast. Nathan is also crushing it on Instagram with nearly 400,000 followers.</p> <p>Nathan will explore how he built a massive following on Instagram.</p> <p>You'll discover techniques you can employ right now for your Instagram strategy.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Instagram Strategy<br /> Why Nathan started Foundr</p> <p>Nathan launched Foundr on March 5, 2013, because he wanted to become an entrepreneur and didn't know where to start. He realized there weren't any magazines targeting aspiring or novice entrepreneurs, only magazines aimed at established businesses.</p> <p>Foundr is a monthly publication, available on iOS and Android mobile devices. Download the app and explore the interactive magazine, which is subscription-based. Once you get inside, Nathan says, it's like a flipbook, where you click and explore.</p> <p>Nathan explains why Foundr differs from a traditional print magazine.</p> <p>Because some people prefer to read and others like to listen, Nathan added a Foundr podcast to the mix after he left his day job. He wanted to share several amazing interviews he'd recorded on Skype. For example, the issue with Tony Robbins on the cover includes a feature article with exclusive material, as well as the audio interview embedded inside the magazine.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how long it took Nathan to leave his job and what he was doing when he started Foundr.</p> <p>Foundr and Instagram</p> <p>Foundr has been on Instagram since November 2014, and has more than 400,000 followers.</p> <p>A year and a half ago, Nathan tried Instagram and was having no success. He shares how a reader from Melbourne who had an entrepreneur page on Instagram with 20,000 followers contacted him. The reader thought if he posted Foundr's Richard Branson cover, he would get Foundr more readers.</p> <p>Nathan shares why the tactic didn't work and what he learned he should have done instead.</p> <p>Last November, Nathan revisited Instagram. He'd already got about 500 followers organically, since Foundr had 20 or 30 images posted. When Nathan did a couple of posts on the Foundr Instagram page, he saw their magazine sales spike on Google Analytics.</p> <p>By this time, the guy from Melbourne was up to 80,000 followers, so Nathan reconnected with him and they started battle-testing different combinations on Instagram to see what would get more followers, encourage people to click on his bio and build his email list. Foundr's email list has since grown considerably, due to traffic from Instagram. Last November, it was around 2,000. Now it's just about to hit 100,000.</p> Is your business on Instagram?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Lewis Howes, co-author of LinkedWorking (a book focused on LinkedIn) and Ultimate Webinar Marketing Guide. His podcast is called The School of Greatness (a top 100 podcast in iTunes). He also has a brand-new book by the same title: The School of Greatness.</p> <p>Lewis will explore how he went from podcasting to a book deal.</p> <p>You'll discover how Lewis pivoted the focus of his business into something he loves.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Podcast to Book Deal<br /> Lewis's journey</p> <p>Lewis says when he thinks of musicians or performers, the ones who are really successful endure for decades by reinventing themselves every three to five years. They do this by following their own dreams and desires, while staying in tune with their audience.</p> <p>Lewis relates this to his own experience with building a couple of different businesses. While one of those businesses served him and other people for a while, Lewis explains there came a time when he was no longer inspired by teaching people about how to maximize LinkedIn.</p> <p>Lewis shares why he transitioned into webinars and ultimately began The School of Greatness podcast three years ago.</p> <p>Lewis explains that a lot of people connected with The School of Greatness podcast. They started asking for more programs, online courses, coaching, events and now a book.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how Lewis and I met, and what he said to me.</p> <p>When and why Lewis started a podcast</p> <p>In 2012, Lewis asked Pat Flynn and Derek Halpern what was working in their businesses to drive traffic, get leads and build their audience. Both of them said their podcast. Find out why he was surprised by their answers.</p> <p>In January 2013, Lewis started podcasting once a week. At the three-and-a-half- to four-month mark, he got an email from iTunes saying they loved what he was doing (the inspiration and guests) and wanted to feature him on their home page.</p> <p>This exposed Lewis to a whole new audience beyond the online marketing audience he'd been building. Now he was reaching people from all over the world who wanted to live a better life.</p> <p>Lewis shares how The School of Greatness started as an interview show and turned into a mixture of interviews and solo episodes.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Lewis came up with the title for his podcast.</p> <p>Lewis's podcast audience and guests</p> <p>Lewis thought his audience was going to be young entrepreneurs, men and women, probably mid 20s to late 30s. He since discovered it serves a much broader audience range: college kids, moms who play it for their kids in the car, the 50-year-old guy who wants to leave his corporate job to build a business, world-class athletes, Do you host a podcast or write a blog?

For instance, you may have a couple of Q&A videos with your staff, an old commercial and some home video of the company picnic. All of these videos have low views, and there's no real cohesive strategy.</p> <p>The second thing Owen calls out is violations of what he refers to as the 3 Ps: Platform, Purpose and People.</p> <p>Marketers often violate the Platform when they repurpose their non-YouTube video content (Google hangouts, Do you create videos for your audience?

The next year, he decided that video online needed to be kicked up a notch.</p> <p>Inspired by the rise of YouTube and the reality show The Apprentice, in 2007 Joel produced and hosted the world's first competitive Internet reality show, called The Next Internet Millionaire, which received an honorary Webby award for reality TV.</p> <p>In 2008 UStream.tv became one of the first tools for streaming live video from a desktop, so he started doing The Joel Comm Show from his offices with co-host Dan Nickerson. They did a weekly interactive show that was usually about an hour long. Sometimes they would have a guest in his studio office, and other times they would just engage with the people who were commenting. It's very similar to how people comment on Blab.</p> <p>Joel believes streaming video is a great way to communicate, broadcast, share and deliver content, and build community.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what was involved with filming The Next Internet Millionaire.</p> <p>Joel and Blab</p> <p>Joel, who has been using Meerkat, Periscope and Live for Facebook Mentions for several months, thinks it was Mia Voss who first told him about Blab. She mentioned it at the beginning of August, and he started using Blab a couple of weeks later. He has been immersed in the platform ever since.</p> <p>He hosts two different shows and then logs on at other random times, either to do a Blab that's not really a show, to hang out and talk with people or to be interviewed on somebody else's show.</p> <p>Joel explains that Blab, in its simplest form, is a video conferencing tool that allows up to four people to be on screen at once. It's integrated with a chat room, and whoever wants to watch a blab can do so. Viewers are also able to interact with each other and the hosts.</p> <p>Blab is integrated with Twitter (your login is your Twitter account), and you're able to easily tweet from the Blab interface. There's a mobile app available for iOS devices and an Android app is on the way.</p> <p>What's so cool about Blab is that it works, Joel says. While Google hangouts sometimes require a whole tutorial, Blab is so simple that most people get it intuitively. Audience members click to request to join a seat. When the host approves you, you're on the show. Do you host live-streaming video? Want to hear about the latest live-casting technology? To discover more about Blab, I interview Joel Comm.

After the financial meltdown in 2008-2009, she ended up taking a package and starting over. Stephanie decided to launch her own business. Initially, she stayed within the financial industry, but then went into the digital marketing space, doing web development and design.</p> <p>For the last five years or so, Stephanie has been writing and speaking about LinkedIn. When she couldn't find a comprehensive resource on LinkedIn, she decided to write one. There were books about your LinkedIn profile and about how to network on LinkedIn, but she wanted one that covered all the bases.</p> <p>Stephanie's book, Linked to Influence, provides a framework for building your own personal brand on LinkedIn, and includes networking and other opportunities as well.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why Stephanie says LinkedIn saved her life.</p> <p>Why people use LinkedIn</p> <p>There are almost 400 million members on LinkedIn, 30% are from the United States and 70% are international. Over 60% of LinkedIn members make more than $75,000 a year and 40% of LinkedIn members make $100,000 or more. The users are affluent, well-educated and come to LinkedIn to really connect with others. They want to find or share information, news and knowledge, but also want to build a network, connect with others and make things happen for their businesses.</p> <p>Stephanie likes how LinkedIn does content aggregation. LinkedIn's Pulse app curates news, based on your network. The smarter your network, the more relevant the content and information you see on Pulse. It includes articles from major media outlets, as well as stories from people you're connected to who are publishing content on LinkedIn's platform.</p> <p>The interface on the Pulse app is fantastic, Stephanie says. You can zip through it, save articles, share them and comment.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn most people's perception of LinkedIn.</p> <p>Benefits of a good network</p> <p>Stephanie refers to cultivating the right LinkedIn community as building a smart network. The smarter your network, the more relevant people and opportunities you attract. Have a valid reason for bringing someone into your network.</p> <p>A smart network has market opportunities uniq...

He has a master from the graduate acting program at New York University. Michael worked professionally on the shows Sex and the City, Third Watch, All My Children, Law & Order and 100 Center Street, as well as in the films The Pelican Brief, Down to Earth and The Believer. He earned a living doing commercial voice overs for companies including AT&T, Pizza Hut, Braun, Coors Beer, MTV and others.</p> <p>After he left acting, Michael says he decided to talk his way into a job for which he was completely unqualified. He pitched himself, got the job and worked his way up in the fitness industry on the business side. He credits his post-acting success to being an actor, as he was able to perform during life's high-stakes situations.</p> <p>When the spotlight and eyes are on you, the way you perform will determine the quality of your life, Michael says.</p> <p>After Michael left the fitness industry, he went into consulting for businesses and started writing books, and he saw it more and more. Over the last 13 years, Michael realized he had to meld his experience and training as an actor, his experience as a professional keynoter and what he knows about the business world.</p> <p>That's what Steal the Show is about, Michael says. Half the book is on the techniques associated with being a great public speaker and the other half is focused on performing during life's everyday situations.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn more about how Michael coaches speakers, as well as why he originally resisted helping people with their public speaking.</p> <p>Why people love stories</p> <p>People love narrative, wonder and imagination, Michael says.

Sometimes the stories we tell actually get in our way and sometimes they can change the world.</p> <p>Michael talks about a researcher named Jonathan Gottschall, who studies the neuroscience behind stories.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Peg Fitzpatrick, the co-author of The Art of Social Media: Power Tips for Power Users, which she wrote with Guy Kawasaki.

This was shortly after the iPad first came out. She loaded Instagram and loved it, but no one she knew was on it.</p> <p>Then, when Pinterest came out, Peg, like a lot of people, thought Pinterest and Instagram were the same, because they were both about images. Although she initially chose to focus on Pinterest, after she learned more about both platforms, Peg discovered how different the two were.</p> <p>When Peg went back to Instagram, she saw it was a great place for people to have conversations.</p> <p>Even if you know lots of people on Facebook, Peg believes Instagram is where you can build a community. As a blogger or entrepreneur, it's the kind of place you want to go to meet new people.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn about why more people didn't get on Instagram immediately.</p> <p>Instagram challenges for marketers </p> <p>Peg believes social media is challenging for marketers because they want to look at things in a more traditional way: how to get people to do x, y and z. The newer platforms, like Snapchat and Instagram, are even more challenging. It's not easy to write a viral blog post or post a YouTube video that goes viral.</p> <p>Instagram is limited, Peg says, because you just get that one link in your bio and there are no links in the comments.</p> <p>While a blogger might not see the value in Instagram ("Why should my blog be on Instagram if there's no link for people to click every day?"), brands are getting more engagement on Instagram than any other social platform. It creates brand awareness that leads more people to your business, events and products.</p> <p>The biggest mistake marketers make, Peg says, is they aren't posting enough. On a recent panel, Peg heard Instagram people who have 500,000+ followers say they post multiple times per day. One of them posts 8 or 10 times per day. And they post excellent content.</p> <p>It takes more time to create an Instagram post. Although you can share a blog post immediately, with Instagram you have to create the image, write the text and figure out all of the things that go with it.</p> <p>On Facebook, people don't post enough either. On Martha Stewart's Facebook page they post every hour. Is your business on Instagram? Are you curious about what to post? To discover how to use images on Instagram, I interview Peg Fitzpatrick.

She worked for Tony Robbins for about six and a half years as director of content development. In that last year Tony got heavily into social media (he did his own Twitter), and Amy worked on Tony's Facebook page.</p> <p>Amy got the entrepreneurial bug, and knew she wanted to go out on her own. She fell in love with social media and she knew that was the area to pursue.</p> <p>While still in the corporate sphere, Amy started educating herself. She asked to be involved with anything related to online marketing and social media. About a year later, she took the leap and left the corporate world. Amy started by doing social media consulting, but eventually built a business around online training courses related to social media marketing.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how Amy and I first connected, and our first experience at Blog World.</p> <p>Why use Facebook ads?</p> <p>Facebook does a lot to help marketers find their ideal audience online.

Facebook allows people to get in front of their perfect audience on a regular basis.</p> <p>Amy breaks down the Facebook targeting options.</p> <p>If you've built up a Facebook business page and have a few thousand fans, start with targeting them. It's the cheapest way to target on Facebook, since you don't pay as much when you target your own fans versus a cold audience.</p> <p>The next thing to do is create a lookalike audience of your own fan base. You tell Facebook that you have these fans, and you want to target people who are similar in likes, interests, activities and behavior. Facebook will give you an audience that's very similar to the one you've already attracted.</p> <p>Then upload your email list to Facebook. Facebook will compare it to their database, and when they find a match, they put the contact in a bucket. This allows you to target people who are already on your email list with a new opportunity. Also, take that email list and ask Facebook to find a lookalike audience.</p> <p>Amy adds a couple of other targeting options to the mix.</p> <p>Target fans of other Facebook pages, such as your competitors or people who are aligned with your business. Amy says the reason she mentioned the other options first is that sometimes when people are first starting out and go to look for similar interests, they struggle to find Facebook pages to pop up.</p> <p>For example, when you put together your ad, if you type "Amy Porterfield" in interests, her page will likely pop up, and you can target her fans. But a lot of pages won't populate, Amy explains. Facebook says it has to do with trending, activity, Are you considering running Facebook ads? Have you tried Facebook ads but have had little success?

Technology, David's other passion, has also run through everything he has done.</p> <p>David recalls his first time on a commercial radio station at WNCI in Columbus, Ohio. At the very end of "Barracuda" by Heart, he came out with "Landshark, candy gram," which was the big bit on Saturday Night Live at the time. From there he played the radio station jingle and headed into his career.</p> <p>After 12 or 13 years as a disk jockey, David's radio station flipped format, and he moved over to talk radio, where he found his stride. From there he went into syndicated radio: SiriusXM. In 2007 David decided that "radio was great, it had its day and I was done with it." It was time to move to on-camera.</p> <p>He says he likes the phrase, "Leap and the net will appear." David just leapt, although he had been preparing and training. Before he did anything on-camera, he learned how the business worked, as well as who the gatekeepers (but not decision-makers) were. That knowledge was helpful when David first started to audition, he says. David booked Heroes within six months of starting the full-on audition process, which is a lot faster than a lot of actors experience with the process.</p> <p>David explains how his one episode of Heroes turned into many. The first day on the set, his character was supposed to get shot and killed. Toward the end of the day, the director gave David new lines. In this newer version, his character had a chair thrown at him and was sent back to prison. "I was new at this and I said, 'Wait a minute. I rehearsed my death scene all weekend. I'm not going to be able to do that?' They responded, 'Do you want to die? Because we talked to your agent and you're in the next eight episodes.'"</p> <p>In addition to all of the legwork and preparation, David says the book, Secrets of Screen Acting (for which he recently finished voicing the audio book version), was also helpful.</p> <p>David also teaches voiceover courses on VO2gogo.com and he created the Rehearsal app. Here's how the app came about.</p> <p>David was in his agent's office and was called to audition across town with little time to prepare. His usual process is to record his lines and his partner's lines. He would then put that recording on iTunes, so he could repeat it until he learned his lines. All he had at his agent's office was his iPhone with voice memo, Do you talk on podcasts or in video? Want to be more comfortable in front of the microphone?

Mashable noticed and asked Ben to write for them. He then came on board as a junior editor, and was promoted to co-editor in 2009, which was when he moved to San Francisco. Ben was with Mashable for 3 1/2 years.</p> <p>As co-editor, Ben was in charge of the West Coast. Since he was the only one in Silicon Valley for a long time, if anything came up in Silicon Valley (like they needed someone to talk to Mark Zuckerberg), they called on Ben. He wrote about 2,400 articles and also helped manage and mentor a lot of reporters and junior editors.</p> <p>Ben's book, Captivology, came about a couple of years ago. When Ben was just starting out investing in companies, he realized they were all asking for help with press and marketing, customer and user acquisition, and virality. He explains that all of these areas are about getting attention for products and getting users.</p> <p>Ben says he did a lot of research, and realized there was a lot of interesting information about attention over the last 50 years, but no one had put it together into something mainstream.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why Captivology was the book he had to write.</p> <p>The science behind the book</p> <p>For Captivology, Ben went through more than 1,000 different research studies and interviewed dozens of PhDs, as well as business leaders and thought leaders, like Sheryl Sandberg, Steven Soderbergh and David Copperfield. They helped him frame the book in a way that there's a lot of science and research, but also practical information. There's knowledge people can use in daily life.</p> <p>Going into the book, Ben had theories about things like reward systems, and confirmed some of his beliefs on how they work.</p> <p>For example, there's a type of reward-giving, called post-action rewards. This is when someone gets a reward as a surprise after completing an action. When you surprise people with a reward, it reinforces behavior.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why incentives are the worst ways to get attention.</p> <p>The three types of attention</p> <p>In Ben's research, he discovered three stages of attention: immediate, short and long attention.</p> <p>Immediate attention. This is the immediate and automatic reaction people have to certain sights, sounds and stimuli. When people hear a gunshot they duck, which is an automatic reaction to protect themselves. There's a lot of fascinating science on how that works and why it matters, Ben says.</p> <p>Short attention. Short attention is the second stage. That's when people start consciously focusing on something. When someone starts watching a show or reading a story about something, that's short attention.

How to subscribe on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Content for Business<br /> When and why Joe started the Content Marketing Institute</p> <p>Joe shares how he got into the content marketing industry. He was vice president of custom media (also known as content marketing) at business publishing company Penton Media until 2007. At Penton, Joe and his team helped advertisers who wanted to do something unique tell their stories. For example, if a company like Microsoft wanted to tell a story to an executive audience, Joe and his team would help them create an ongoing newsletter, a magazine, blog series or webinar series. Joe did that for seven years.</p> <p>Joe left Penton at the end of March 2007 and wrote his first blog post titled "Why Content Marketing?" on April 26, 2007. That led up to Joe launching Junta42, which he says was basically the eHarmony for content marketing. The idea was to match brand sites that wanted to outsource some portion of the content process (creation or distribution) with agencies that would pay for the service to get the leads.</p> <p>Joe explains how in 2008, with no money, no paid distribution and about 2,000 subscribers, he decided it was time to build relationships with influencers. He started a research project called The Top 100 Content Marketing Blogs. (I was on the list first for White Papers and then Social Media Examiner.) He notified everybody who was on the list, and it just took off.</p> <p>Fast-forward to 2009, Joe shares, the model was working and they matched up about 1,000 projects. However, they were still having trouble getting companies to pay for a subscription to the service, even though they were driving leads to them. After his best case study (they sent a $1 million+ customer to an agency, and the agency decided not to renew their subscription), it finally hit Joe that this business was not going to work.</p> <p>Although Joe was "in love with his product," he finally figured out the key was to fall in love with your audience and focus on their needs and pain points. His audience was asking for training, education, consulting and speaking. They weren't even ready for a matching service, because they didn't even know how to create a content marketing strategy.</p> <p>Joe pivoted to the education and training concept and launched Content Marketing Institute six months later. That was May 2010.</p> <p>"At that moment we said we were going to create the leading online destination for content marketing, the leading magazine and the leading event," Joe recalls. "And within two years we were able to do that."</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Joe and I first connected, as well as the similarities between our projects.</p> Do you have a great idea for a business?

So Chalene changed her password to something out of the ordinary, logged back in and changed her bio.</p> <p>Then, it happened again. The hackers were sending out porn and tweeting other people at the same time Chalene was on Twitter. Her other accounts were hacked as well. She felt like she wasn't safe in her own home. Even though it was an Internet attack and there wasn't a physical threat, Chalene recalls that it felt like it.</p> <p>Darren shares where he was on the night of Chalene's cyberattack. He and his wife just got home from dinner and were flipping through Instagram when they noticed that Chalene's account had content she normally wouldn't post. So he texted her and said he thought she'd been hacked. She wrote back that she knew and was freaking out. He said to call him so they could get it under control and get the hackers out of her system.</p> <p>By the time Chalene called Darren, her Twitter, Instagram and Facebook had been taken over. And, though she didn't realize it yet, the hackers were also in her inbox.</p> <p>Chalene and Darren spent eight hours, working through the night, trying to patch everything up.</p> <p>People assume it's personal, Chalene says, but that's not the case. It hit her especially hard because social media is her livelihood. The hackers deleted everything she posted on Instagram over the last four and a half years, and they started posting videos of animal cruelty and violent porn. Chalene felt helpless and responsible. The cost of the hack, which included security experts, loss of wages and rebuilding her security, was in excess of $200,000.</p> <p>Darren says hacking is a sport for some people and a hobby for others. They are experts in their field. Since they don't have legal ways to demonstrate their expertise, this is how they do it.</p> <p>Don't worry about hackers, Darren suggests. Focus on what you need to do to protect yourself. Situations like this expose holes that we knew existed, and that we should have patched, but kept putting it off. It's like waiting until a health condition pops up and then deciding to get in shape. Sometimes it takes an unfortunate disaster to get someone to appreciate the value of simple preventive measures.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how engaging with the hackers made things worse ...

First, there's the "thought" element. It starts with people who have excellent forward thinking, stay on the cutting edge and push boundaries, understand deeply how things work and are able to articulate it.</p> <p>And second, they must be a "leader," someone whom others listen to and follow. A thought leader does those things over time, consistently producing material that people will listen to month in and month out.</p> <p>Before I started Social Media Examiner, I was called one of the leading authorities in the white paper world. To earn that, I constantly wrote articles, started a blog, did training, wrote a book, summarized industry research and had a monthly newsletter.</p> <p>Establishing yourself as a thought leader is a lot of work. Even harder is maintaining it. Mari Smith is an excellent example of someone who chose to own her title of "Facebook Expert," and is having great results.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how long Phil and I have been working together and what we did before Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>How we decide who should be on the podcast and on our stages</p> <p>When deciding on our content, we ask two questions: "What should people speak about?" and "Who should speak about those subjects?"</p> <p>To determine what people will speak about, we look very carefully at the data, Phil explains. We study our annual Social Media Marketing Industry Report, which is based on the subjects our readers tell us they do and do not care about. It influences decisions about the kinds of speakers we need to find, which sometimes means we need to seek out experts we don't know yet.</p> <p>If you want to pitch yourself to a conference or podcast, it's important to first study it. Look at the organization's typical lineup to see what kinds of things people are speaking about, and determine if you're a fit.</p> <p>Not every thought leader is appropriate for every situation. We get inquires all the time from people who pitch us things that aren't appropriate.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how booking speakers is like programming for television.</p> <p>What we look for in our speakers</p> <p>Phil and I share the four criteria we look for in a speaker.</p> <p>1. Are they a great communicator?</p> <p>We're not just looking for inspirational communicators, we are looking for people who can explain or teach at a very deep level how to use the different social media platforms.</p> <p>A lot of people think they're great communicators, but a lot of people also think they're good drivers. I share how when Sally Hogshead was keynoting at Social Media Marketing World, she said "Raise your hand if you think you are a good driver." About 95% of the hands went up in the room.

Part of this is for local businesses, so they can appear on a map, get reviews and so on.</p> <p>Martin has been doing research on this and says businesses are not quite connecting the dots on Google+ marketing and using this powerful tool. He says as of last year, only 37% of businesses had claimed their Google listing, 63% have not.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover more about Google My Business.</p> <p>The impact of reviews</p> <p>Martin has spoken to hundreds of businesses (owners and staff) about reviews. People use reviews as a socialized way to judge the businesses around them, which get more customers as a result of reviews.</p> <p>For example, Martin shares, Tasty Thai in San Mateo can attribute thousands of dollars of revenue to one single positive Yelp review from a guy who had been to Thailand and loves their Thai food.</p> <p>At the moment Yelp has a lot of people's attention, and Martin hopes Google reviews will get to that level as well.</p> <p>Reviews can bring tourists, new people and new business. The downside is there's the potential for negative reviews.</p> <p>"[Businesses have to have] good service, good product and sometimes be willing to say when you haven't got it 100% right," Martin says.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear about an amazing experience I had while traveling, based on a Yelp review.</p> <p>Google listings</p> <p>Martin explains how Google sometimes auto-generates a business listing, and a lot of people's businesses are listed without them knowing about it.<br /> To determine if your business has an auto-generated listing, Google your location to see if anything comes up. If it doesn't, go to Google.com/business to set one up. If it is already set up, click where it says "claim this listing," so you can control uploading photos, reply to posted reviews and more. When you set up a page on Google they verify it by phone or by mail.<br /> There are two different types of local pages, Martin continues, a storefront and a service area. If you run your business from home, say you are a service area to hide your address.</p> <p>Once you've claimed your property or set up your page from scratch, there are several things you can do: change the profile image (which is the icon people see when you make comments or reply to reviews), change your cover photo, manage your photos, add what you do to the description area, post on that Google page, reply to reviews, share reviews and more.</p> <p>You can even embed the best reviews on your website. This is how you take the social proof you get from reviews and spread it onto your website.</p> <p>The Google My Business dashboard provides a higher-level frame-of-reference around the thin...

A couple years ago, he decided it was time to take the plunge into social media.</p> <p>Driving home from a long road trip, Jeff was listening to the Social Media Marketing Podcast episode with Cynthia Sanchez, and got intrigued by Pinterest. Once he started playing on the platform, Jeff noticed it was driving a lot of traffic to his relatively new blog.</p> <p>After Jeff's Google+ post, called Manly Pinterest Tip #1, about sharing a secret board with his daughter, did really well, he wrote Manly Pinterest Tips #2-5.  Jeff explains that his concept for Pinterest was a play on the fact that everyone thinks Pinterest is for women. His "manly" version really took off.</p> <p>Jeff did an initial version of his podcast with four other guys. They did seven episodes before switching formats. At the beginning of the year, Jeff brought back the Manly Pinterest Tips podcast as a solo, weekly show, and has interviewed Pinterest experts, like Peg Fitzpatrick, Rebekah Radice and Cynthia Sanchez. He's done about 30 episodes.</p> <p>Since the Manly Pinterest Tips podcast did well, Jeff embarked on an experiment in branding. He figured it took a year to grow a good, manly beard. So he decided he would launch the website and build the brand for a year. "If it doesn't work, I can shave the beard off, it'll be fine," he says. "Well, it worked."</p> <p>Jeff explains the concept of secret and group boards. A secret board is something that only you or you and other people you designate can see. They are a great way to gather info for yourself or for collaboration. You can also create public group boards. Jeff has a board with Peg Fitzpatrick about bacon and an Instant Instagram Tips.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear more about Jeff’s secret boards.</p> <p>Men & Pinterest</p> <p>Contrary to popular belief, there is tons of stuff for guys on Pinterest.

"H2H was a surprise baby," Bryan says.</p> <p>He set Shareology aside and continued with the other, because the Human to Human philosophy seemed to resonate more. Plus, he says, Human to Human provides the best platform used for sharing and not the other way around.</p> <p>Shareology, which is two years in the making, is the study of how, what, where, when and why people and brands share. As a self-proclaimed anthropologist, Bryan has a lot of interest in the subject.</p> <p>Bryan says he always asks his audience what class they took on sharing. In kindergarten, kids learn how to share their toys, but that's about it. It's a skill people learn on top of school, and is part of some classes, like communications, but is not a focus.</p> <p>Social sharing comes in many different flavors, he explains. Meerkat and Periscope are new flavors, but there are so many more. Shareology focuses on the evolution of sharing: the past, present and future.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn how people shared articles before social media.</p> <p>Why people share</p> <p>For the book Bryan did more than 250 interviews with executives, marketers and social media people, as well as professors of linguistics, psychology, sociology and so on, with the question "why people share" in mind.</p> <p>The answer came down to one thing: connection. People all have the desire to reach out and connect with other people, whether it's through sharing content and having someone reply back or by sharing other people's content and helping them out.</p> <p>These are the six types of people who share:</p> <p> Altruist: Someone who shares something specific about one topic all the time.<br /> Careerist: Someone who wants to become a thought leader in their own industry, so they can see their career grow.<br /> Hipster: Someone who likes to try things for the first time and share it faster than everyone else.<br /> Boomerang: Someone who asks a question so they can receive a comment only to reply. (This can be a troll, but not necessarily. It can be a positive or a negative situation.)<br /> Connector: Someone who likes to connect one or more persons to each other.<br /> Selective: This is the observer, which some people call a lurker. The majority of the internet observes and then selectively picks pieces to direct or private message other people.</p> <p>Bryan says, while people ebb and flow between different types, we all tend to lean toward one. For example, tech evangelist Robert Scoble is primarily a Hipster, but it doesn't mean he isn't a Careerist or a Selective too.</p> <p>Bryan also touches on the future of sharing.</p> <p>Bryan interviewed the chief scientist of Watson Analytics and learned the computer system Watson (t...

This means any third-party developer can create an app that will work with Messenger. So if someone sends you a link to something in a Facebook message, it may ask you to install an app when you click on it.</p> <p>Messenger is also integrating with businesses, although there are only a few online merchants doing this as of now. With this functionality, when people make a purchase, Messenger will ask them if they want to get updates for this merchant via Facebook Messenger. That's almost as good as having a person's cell phone number, Mari explains, because there's a high open rate for SMS messages.</p> <p>Using this technology, merchants can make purchase recommendations or send shipment updates via Messenger, for example. It basically opens up the dialog between the business and the customer.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Instant Articles are similar to LinkedIn Publisher.</p> <p>Why businesses should use Facebook for customer service</p> <p>Mari believes Facebook should be part of a business's customer service plan, since most people are already on Facebook and many use Facebook through mobile devices.</p> <p>Mari talks about how she was recently interviewed for a Wall Street Journal article on how companies like JP Morgan and Coca-Cola are turning off voicemail, and cutting millions of dollars in expenses by doing this. Mari thinks it's a sign of the times. The biggest challenge for businesses is that customers have so many different ways to contact them: a tweet or DM on Twitter or a Facebook wall post, comment or direct message. It can be unwieldy.</p> <p>Companies should also look at the features recently added for business pages on Facebook. The newest call to action button on ads is "Call Now." Facebook wants people to call businesses. Are your customers active on Facebook? Have you got a plan to support your customers via Facebook?

After seeing what was on there, he decided to upload his first video. It was a quick, 30-second video of him talking to the camera. He had no idea where that first experience would lead.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sbC_K0cCUI</p> <p>As this was pre-Facebook, Tim says he and his girlfriend at the time made videos to show their friends and family what they were up to. They made videos of their dates, engagement and wedding, as well as when they moved, had kids and so on. Tim believes they made about 1,000 videos just sharing their story. It started as a way to communicate with family and friends. Along the way, other people started watching.</p> <p>Around 2009, Tim reached out to Mark Robertson, ReelSEO, and YouTube personality Kevin Nalty, and asked them why certain things did and did not work on YouTube. When they didn't know the answers, Tim decided to figure it out himself. He said he'd report back to them what he learned.</p> <p>Tim began having conversations with people who were trying to figure out the same things about YouTube and audience growth. That was the start of him turning YouTube into his business.</p> <p>A while later, Tim reached out to Mark Robertson again with constructive feedback. Tim told Mark that while he had a great website about video, there was nothing being done with online video. Tim ended up taking over Mark's YouTube channel, and trained the site's viewers how to master YouTube as a platform for audience development.</p> <p>After a few years, Tim started working full time for an animation studio to do audience development for their web series. A year later, after he had grown it to almost 100,000 subscribers, Tim's job was eliminated. However, they paid him full-time for six months to get his own business started.</p> <p>In February 2013, Tim launched his YouTube channel, called Video Creators. By the end of six months, it was his full-time income.</p> <p>Video Creators has three series on it. Every Tuesday, Tim talks about news in the online video industry. Wednesdays, he shares a YouTube tip. Then, on Thursdays he answers a question from his audience. The channel revolves around using online video as a platform to change lives.</p> <p>Without spending any money on promotion, Tim has grown his YouTube channel to over 75,000 subscribers and more than four-million views. He gets tons of interaction and engagement, including about 15,000 comments a month.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what YouTube was like in the beginning.</p> <p>Common mistakes with video</p> <p>The biggest mistake Tim sees people make with video is that they treat it like it's the same as television.

They decided to move forward, even though there were plenty of things that could have prevented them from even getting started.</p> <p>Jared explains how they reached out to a few people who had put on large events, and asked for their perspective and advice. One person who gave them a lot of feedback was Phillip Taylor, who does a conference for financial bloggers. Armed with information, they turned to Kickstarter to crowdfund the conference.</p> <p>They just needed a small amount ($11,000) to validate the idea, and they weren't sure if it would take 30 days to raise the money or if they'd even get it at all. They asked the podcast community if they would support the conference, speak at it and share it with their network. A lot of people said yes, Jared shares, "but it's one thing to say yes and it's another thing to vote with your wallet."</p> <p>When the campaign was published, they hit that $11,000 within 9 hours. At the end of the 30 days, they had over three times the amount needed, which was more than enough validation to sell tickets, pursue sponsors and follow through. Six hundred people came to the first Podcast Movement Conference.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear more about the Podcast Movement Kickstarter campaign.</p> <p>Why Jared started a Facebook group</p> <p>The Podcast Movement created a Facebook page so they could do ads and other promotions leading up to the conference, but they didn't initially have a Facebook group. Although they went to other podcast-focused Facebook groups to spread the word, they had to be careful, because some of the groups had a smart but strict policy on self-promotion.</p> <p>As soon as the first event was over, there was so much excitement that they realized they needed to create a way for the attendees to continue conversations. That's when Jared and his co-founders started the Facebook group. Not even a year later, the group has 1,600 members and is growing every month.</p> <p>The group is called Podcast Movement - Past, Present, and Future Attendees, so it's open to all past and potential attendees. This way, anyone who is interested in podcasting can be involved in the community and the conversations.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn the original intent of the group.</p> <p>How the two Facebook communities have helped Jared's business</p> <p>The Podcast Movement group and page have served two different purposes.

He would go to hunting camps with his father and uncles, and they would sit around the campfire, tell stories about hunting and talk about life. Collin found he had a passion for hunting, and wanted to figure out how to make a living from it.</p> <p>In high school Collin started building websites, doing graphic design and using social media (at the time it was MySpace and the beginning of Twitter) to build his way into the hunting outdoor industry. For example, he worked on Bowhunting.net (which was on AOL in 1994 and then launched fully in 1996). Collin also attended hunting and outdoor trade shows, such as the Archery Trade Show, where he would interview the different dealers and put the videos on their websites.</p> <p>The hunting industry needed a new way to market to their growing customer base with social media, Collin says, and that’s how he found his niche.</p> <p>At the same time Collin was going to trade shows, he was building his own marketing company on the side. Developing relationships with major players in the hunting industry was a huge boost to his business.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover the similarity between how Collin and I got started, even though we're in very different niches.</p> <p>Collin's start on Facebook</p> <p>Around 2007, Collin launched a graphics/web design/marketing agency with a focus on the hunting and outdoor industry. Facebook pages were just being introduced, so Collin decided to create hunting-related pages to build communities.</p> <p>In addition to the bowhunting page, he started pages for shed hunting, turkey hunting and more.</p> <p>Facebook was different at the time, Collin recalls. If you put out good content, and you had a good following, you could reach a lot of people. He put interesting, informative, value-driven content on the page, such as questions, pictures and videos.</p> <p>A short time later, Collin decided to create a whitetail deer hunting page, since it’s the top tier in the hunting industry in America. He did crossovers from the other pages to get fans to the new one. This Facebook page grew organically very quickly through contests, content and posting several times a day.</p> <p>A year and a half ago, when they were at 500,000 fans, they were able to reach 25 to 50 million people a month. Whitetail Overload launched August 1, 2014.</p> <p>Since Collin is a web and graphic designer, he was able to build landing pages and apps for his giveaways right in Facebook, Wondering how to grow your Facebook following without resorting to paid advertising?

He is always looking for ways people can leverage technology to be more productive and tell their story in unique ways. Brian likes to jump on every new app: it’ll either fail fast, and he’ll uninstall it or he'll run with it! Mobile broadcasting definitely falls into the later category.</p> <p>Brian shares how he was introduced to Meerkat. He was speaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, when he got a message from someone who worked at Twitter, telling him that Ashton Kutcher and Gary Vaynerchuck were on a new video app. About 35 seconds later, Brian had downloaded it and clicked the start button.</p> <p>Meerkat came out February 26, 2015, and Brian was on it March 2.</p> <p>Brian took to Meerkat immediately. He put his mobile device on his tripod, hit the stream button, put in the event hashtag and was live. He treated it like he does his regular YouTube videos: walking around, describing the event and sharing it with his audience.</p> <p>About three minutes in, someone commented, “I see the Samsung booth, can you turn to your right.” That’s when Brian realized he didn’t just bring the experience to his audience, he was letting his viewers be a part of it. People in the United States could dictate what they saw in Spain. "It felt interactive, like having a true conversation," he recalls.</p> <p>Since Brian was about to go to South by Southwest,  he put some strategy behind his Meerkating. Brian contacted a couple of brands that were holding different events, and asked for backstory, so he could be prepared to cover them. During SXSW, Brian did a Meerkat of all the sessions he went to, as well as a preview each morning and recap every evening. About 300-800 people watched each stream, no matter what he was talking about.</p> <p>Periscope was released into the Apple store during Social Media Marketing World (the last week of March 2015), and Brian recalls using Periscope for first time during the opening keynote.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear where Brian was when he heard about Periscope at Social Media Marketing World.</p> <p>How live streaming apps work</p> <p>"Live streaming isn’t anything new," Brian explains. "It’s really just turning on a video and opening the portal to anyone who wants to use it."</p> <p>What's new is the fact that we’re able to download an app, sign in with a Twitter account or phone number, click stream and post the link. Then anybody in your Twitter community can click on that link and watch whatever you’re showing on your phone. The big piece is the mobile aspect. It’s as simple as a basic tweet and hitting the “stream” button.</p> Are you interested in live mobile broadcasting? Have you tried Meerkat or Periscope?

The first thing Vani's father introduced her mother to was a McDonald's hamburger. Since cows are sacred in India, her mother had never eaten a hamburger before and it was a shock to her system. It turned out American food didn't sit well with Vani's mother, so she just made Indian food at home.</p> <p>However, she let Vani and her brother eat whatever they wanted. Because the siblings wanted to fit in with their neighbors and peers (Indian food looked weird and smelled funny to some of the other kids), they shunned their mother's cooking and asked for fast food and other processed foods.</p> <p>As a result, Vani had a lot of health issues as a child: eczema, asthma, allergies and stomachaches. She didn't tie them to food; she thought they were largely genetic, because her brother also had health issues. Many years later, her health issues caught up with her. Vani was working in a prestigious job for a big-six consulting firm shortly after she graduated from college. She gained over 30 pounds right away (eating catered meals brought into the office and fancy dinners out), and landed in the hospital with appendicitis. Vani didn't look or feel well. It was a major wake-up call.</p> <p>After her recovery, when Vani got back to work, she started to research health and nutrition. She wanted to lose the weight and get healthy.</p> <p>Vani set out to learn about what she was eating; what the ingredients were, why they were in the food and why the food companies were using them. She discovered the chemicals put in food (many of which were invented in the last 50 years or so) were there just to improve the bottom line of the food industry, to figure out how to sell food cheaper by using food-like substances and making them taste like real food. Vani realized the majority of the food she had been eating was processed and had little to no nutrients left in it.</p> <p>The health incident happened 14 years ago and Vani started the blog 4 years ago. The Food Babe Way is all about adopting healthy eating habits.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what Vani's aunt told her cousin about Vani's new look.</p> <p>FoodBabe.com</p> <p>Vani says she created the blog because her co-workers and friends asked her to.</p> <p>She explains how she came up with the name. After asking her husband to register the name EatHealthlyLiveForever.com, Vani recalls him saying, "Are you crazy? That's a horrible name. No one's going to remember that." She asked him to come up with something better.

Twitter and microblogging interested Joel, since he had already been blogging for several years.</p> <p>In May 2007 Joel posted his first tweet. "In true, first-tweet form, it was utterly forgettable," Joel recalls. "I think it was something like 'Trying to figure out what this Twitter thing is.'"</p> <p>That was about it, until six months later, when Joel gave Twitter another try. He looked more closely, and decided Twitter was a cool platform for engagement. Sometime in 2008, after Joel accumulated about 5,000 followers, a friend told him John Wiley & Sons was looking for somebody to write a book on how to use Twitter for business. They connected and hit it off. The first edition of Twitter Power came out in February 2009.</p> <p>At the time, many were still trying to figure out Twitter, which posed the question, "What are you doing?"</p> <p>"We began to realize the heart of social media is about sharing life, relationships, the journey that we are on together," Joel says. "It's the points of commonality that we have in many of these mundane activities ... that bring us closer together. Therein lies the power of Twitter to connect people."</p> <p>An organic tweeter, Joel uses Twitter.com and the Twitter app on his phone. For those who like to consolidate and schedule tweets, he recommends tools like SocialOomph and Hootsuite.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear both of our initial thoughts on Twitter.</p> <p>How the retweeting process has changed</p> <p>In the past if people wanted to retweet something, they would have to take all of the original tweet's text, copy it and put "RT" in front of it. They could only comment if there was any space left in the 140 characters.</p> <p>Joel believes Twitter finally realized that when people want to retweet, they have something they want to say about it. So now, if you want to retweet, you can quote that tweet and still have 116 additional characters left to add to it.</p> <p>This change makes these retweets feel like more of a conversation, because it puts all related tweets together.</p> <p>The way it works is simple. If you are in the app, you can retweet and share as is or quote the tweet. If you are on the site and you click Retweet, it opens up a window and you can comment or just retweet.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what Joel thinks of the Twitter character limit.</p> <p>Twitter video</p> <p>Joel starts by talking about Vine. You can record a Vine video and it automatically goes to Twitter. In addition to doing a straight video, Vine allows you to do creative things. For example, you can hold down the recording button, let up with your thumb, Do you use Twitter for your business? Want to discover how to use the latest Twitter updates?

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Stand Out<br /> Dorie's backstory</p> <p>Dorie started her marketing and strategy consulting business nine years ago, following a pretty eclectic career. After studying theology in graduate school, Dorie was a political reporter, a spokesperson for first a gubernatorial and then a presidential campaign, and ran a non-profit.</p> <p>Through her journey, Dorie noticed increasing numbers of people reinventing themselves, so she wrote Reinventing You to capture best practices for the process. She then realized the next challenge (after you find the place to make your mark) is to become a recognized expert.</p> <p>She wanted to learn from the best, so Dorie interviewed 50 top thought leaders, including Seth Godin, Daniel Pink and David Allen, to try to figure out how they came up with their breakthrough ideas and built their following.</p> <p>Dorie wanted to demolish the myth that famous people are perceived as having always been famous. There are certain replicable actions that anyone can do with the right strategy.</p> <p>One common thread is that all of the people she profiled are known for their ideas. The idea comes first, and then these people roll up their sleeves and work in the trenches in their profession to spread their ideas.</p> <p>Mindset is a key factor in whether someone will be successful. Dorie refers to Carol Dweck from Stanford University, who talks about a growth mindset versus a fixed mindset. If you have a growth mindset and you're not getting the results you want, you believe if you change what you're doing, you'll get those results. If you have a fixed mindset and you're not getting the results you want, you think it must be because you're not smart or talented enough, and there's nothing you can do to change it.</p> <p>Sharing ideas puts you in a position of vulnerability, because it's possible people won't like them. However, it's fundamentally an act of generosity if you have ideas you believe can help the world.</p> <p>People need to step up and be willing to share their ideas, because those who are doing it now are no different than anyone else. They are just willing to do something differently.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn more about what stops most people from becoming successful.</p> <p>Why create a breakthrough idea?</p> <p>A breakthrough idea is something new and valuable that you (and often only you) can contribute, Dorie explains. This is more important than ever, because the world we live in today is so competitive and globalized. There is always going to be someone willing to do the work for less money than you.</p> <p>Ten years ago, if you needed a website designed, you went to the Chamber of Commerce mixer to see who does websites, and you picked a designer. Now, Are you wondering how to stand out in the noisy online world? Want to build your status as a thought leader? To discover new ways how to stand out, I interview Dorie Clark.

All eras last about 20 years. According to Robert, we are now in the 6th era, which is relationship marketing. The Relationship Era was kicked off in the early 1990s with The One to One Future by Dr. Martha Rogers and Don Peppers, which gave birth to the CRM movement.</p> <p>As we move into 2015, Robert explains, we are evolving into a new era. "Developing delightful, informative, useful experiences from marketing's lens is really the new way to formulate a marketing strategy going forward," he says.</p> <p>Robert shares more about the evolution of the eras and how they inform this new one.</p> <p>From the early 1990s and into the Internet era (the late 1990s and early 2000s) the goal was to figure out how to develop a database or a relationship with our consumer and deepen it through the use of data, as well as how to assemble richer data sets around the consumer to be able to deliver a better product or service to that consumer, using that relationship. This is what gave birth to the CRM movement as we know it today.</p> <p>As this era progressed, and social media within it, relationship development between a brand and its consumers became more complex. These days, digital more broadly disrupts how we relate to consumers, since we now have to establish a relationship from that first meeting and beyond.</p> <p>That expansion of marketing's responsibility for the full life cycle of the consumer, and the complexity brought on by all of the different channels, are creating a real evolution of marketing. We need to develop more compelling experiences to be able to delight those customers at various stages of their journey.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover more about the book.</p> <p>What Robert means when he talks about experiences </p> <p>When a business creates a website or something with a physical dimension, such as a conference or a print magazine, it's creating an experience for its audience. The hope is to deliver value that's separate and discrete from the company's product or service.</p> <p>Robert shares a few examples.</p> <p>Kraft makes macaroni and cheese, as well as other products. However, Kraft's Food & Family magazine and Kraft's online recipes are experiences. They are value delivered to a consumer that's separate from the company's products.</p> <p>Another example would be a home cookware shop that teaches cooking classes as a means of providing a physical experience. Are you looking for a competitive advantage? Have you thought about creating experiences for your audience?

When he broke his arm the summer between high school and college, his dreams fell apart.</p> <p>As a baseball pitcher, Dale felt pitchers know how to lead the team, so he decided to create a business. Dale started a fitness company, which grew rapidly but was unsatisfying. So he sold the business. After that he worked in the stock market for a while, before raising money and opening a rock-climbing gym. Dale thought things were going well until he got pulled into the yoga room by one of his business partners and was fired from his own company for being a "horrible leader."</p> <p>Dale changed. He explains how for a few years he went on a frenzy starting companies before hitting a wall. Dale realized chasing profits wasn't putting meaning in his soul. He wanted to figure out how to blend purpose and profit, and this was the beginning of Sevenly. He was 25.</p> <p>"I said, 'let's create a company where every week, we partner with a new charity,'" Dale recalls. "We would create products like shirts and hats and beanies and jackets, and any time somebody bought one of our products, we would give $7 to the charity that week. So if we sold 1,000 products, we'd give that charity $7,000."</p> <p>Sevenly sold 800 products the first week. A few months later, they grew to 10 employees, then 20 employees, and two years later, 45 employees. Sevenly launched on June 13, 2013.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neHwgakQcGI</p> <p>Dale explains that seeing money not as the primary goal, but as a byproduct of helping a million people, was the shift. He got lost in something that was so much fun and literally changing the world. Sevenly has raised $4.2 million in $7 donations.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn about the "aha" moment that set Dale on this path.</p> <p>The system businesses need to break</p> <p>Dale explains the cycle of companies. They often start with a cycle of honesty and move into an era of efficiency. When companies get big, they go from people over profit to people and profit, and become addicted to more. They start confusing being bigger with being better, he adds.</p> <p>What often comes after the efficient era is what Dale calls the deceptive era. This is when businesspeople start to lose their soul and forget why they started the company. At that point they either go out of business, or those who stick around enter the final apologetic era. That's where they earn back consumers' trust, and go back into the honest cycle.</p> <p>For example, Does your business have a purpose beyond making money?

At that time the computer lab was basically a windowless cave with 20 rows of 20 computers each, Ted recalls. Early one morning working in the lab, he noticed the ambient light was blue. It was because the Netscape screen was mostly blue, and that's the site everyone used.</p> <p>After 20 minutes or so of searching fruitlessly and getting frustrated with Netscape, somebody leaned over and suggested Ted try Google, which he did.</p> <p>Ted's test search term was his mother's name, Dr. Lynette Wright, a fairly famous medical geneticist. However, since they share the same last name as the guys who invented airplanes, most search engines easily got confused.</p> <p>"Google returned my mother as the second search term, instead of eight pages deep, which was the norm for other sites," Ted shares. He kept working and 20 minutes later, Ted noticed the guy next to him getting frustrated. So Ted leaned over and explained Google to him.</p> <p>About four or five hours later, Ted finished working, stood up, looked around and noticed the light in the room changed from the ambient blue of Netscape to the ambient white of the Google screen.</p> <p>Ted, who's always trying to figure out how things work, found that very interesting. So during his second year at the University of Chicago, he blew apart the history, math, psychology and epidemiology of word-of-mouth marketing.</p> <p>After graduation, Ted decided to start his own business. That company, which he started 15 years ago, is now called Fizz.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover the unique way in which Ted watched TiVo and Google get adopted.</p> <p>The importance of word-of-mouth marketing</p> <p>Ted defines word-of-mouth marketing as "identifying your influencers and coming up with a story that is interesting, relevant and authentic that ladders back to qualities of your brand and then sharing that story as much as possible."</p> <p>That's the first part. The second part, Ted says, is "creating for your influencers as many opportunities as you can as a brand or a company for them if they feel like it to share your brand's story with as many people as they would like to do so."</p> <p>Ted shares the word-of-mouth marketing campaign he ran for Pabst Blue Ribbon (P.B.R.) with the brand manager at the time, Neal Stewart. The goal was to get more people in America to drink P.B.R.</p> <p>Ted identifies the three critical components of a story being shared:</p> <p> Is the story interesting to influencers so they will pick it up, study it and really understand it?<br /> Do you want more people to talk about your brand or business?

Rory says it also means he knows more about makeup than cars.</p> <p>During college at the University of Denver, Rory was recruited to work in a program called Southwestern Advantage, where he sold educational children's reference books door-to-door and eventually managed salespeople. He says that's where he developed a passion for sales.</p> <p>In 2006, Rory and three others started Southwestern Consulting, with the mission to help salespeople achieve their goals in life. They now have 115 team members and are working with more than 1,000 people.</p> <p>Rory's first book, Take the Stairs, is all about the psychology of overcoming procrastination, improving self-discipline and getting yourself to do things you know you should do that you don't feel like doing. It answers the question, "How do the most disciplined people in the world get themselves to be disciplined?"</p> <p>Rory's second book, Procrastinating on Purpose, addresses the question, "How do the most successful people today think about time and do they believe the same clichés we often hear about time management?" Rory says a lot of them don't.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what launched Rory's speaking career.</p> <p>Why people struggle with time management</p> <p>Rory says there is no such thing as time management, only self management.</p> <p>In the world we live in today, time management isn't just logical, it's emotional. Our feelings of guilt, fear, worry and anxiety, as well as our desire for success and our need to feel valued dictate how we spend our time—as much as our inbox, our to-do list and our calendar do. There's also a new type of thinker that has emerged: the multiplier.</p> <p>Rory shares the history of time management.</p> <p>Era one time-management thinking is one-dimensional. It was developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and was all about efficiency. All things being equal, doing things faster is better. However, there is a point of diminishing returns with efficiency.</p> <p>Era two time-management thinking is two-dimensional. This was ushered in by Dr. Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, in the late 80s. Dr. Covey gave us the time-management matrix. The Y axis was importance (how much something matters) and the X axis was urgency (how soon it matters), so it was a way to score tasks and prioritize based on their score. While prioritizing is a relevant skill today, there is a massive limitation—nothing about prioritizing creates more time.</p> <p>Rory believes you cannot solve today's time-management prob...

For example, he'd work for a toothbrush brand in the morning and an enterprise data client in the afternoon. This is how he started making connections among industries and began thinking about trends. Rohit started writing trend reports in 2011.</p> <p>Rohit's experience includes working with Leo Burnett in Australia and Ogilvy in the United States. He did digital strategy and even worked on Intel's first social media guidelines.</p> <p>One of the biggest problems, Rohit explains, is a lot of trends are self-serving. "Imagine I have a company that sells hammers, and then I declare 2015 the year of hammers," he laughs. "How convenient is that?"</p> <p>People declare trends based on whatever they sell so it helps them, but what they point to isn't actually a trend.</p> <p>Rohit considers a trend to be an observation about the accelerating present. That means there are signs of something already happening that will become more important. A trend will either change the way consumers make decisions or change the way companies structure their business models or how they do business.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover one of the biggest mistakes many trend writers make.</p> <p>Why marketers should care about trends</p> <p>The biggest benefit to knowing about trends, Rohit explains, is to know when to pivot. The term pivot is frequently used improperly. For example, if someone sells bicycles and then becomes a coffee shop, it's not a pivot, it's a completely new business.</p> <p>An actual pivot was seen when BMW, in addition to making cars, decided to start a program called DriveNow in which they rent electric cars. They're tapping into the trend of the sharing and collaborative economy, and experimenting with their business model. BMW is saying we still make super high-quality cars, but we now distribute them in different ways: we sell, lease and rent them.</p> <p>That's smart, Rohit says. It's the way to look at something that's happening in the marketplace and see how it affects your business.</p> <p>Marketers need to be on the lookout for trends and pivot accordingly, but also understand trends that are already happening.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn about Rohit's haystack method and the difference between trend curating and trendspotting.</p> <p>Glanceable content</p> <p>The trend of glanceable content is a reaction to our shrinking attention spans, Rohit explains. There's material out there, like BuzzFeed headlines, that tantalize us so much we can't help clicking on them.</p> <p>But that alone doesn't make it a trend.</p> <p>This idea of the shrinking attention span leads to innovation in unexpected places. There's a team of MIT researchers working on studies ... Do you want to stay on top of the latest marketing trends? Looking to tap into the next big trend?

He realized if he was going to talk about Twitter, blogging and Facebook, he had to use them. So he started a blog as an experiment. It took him about 9 months to find his voice, Mark recalls. It dawned on him that all of his contacts and business were coming through his blog, so he needed to pay attention to it. The blog really started kicking in around 2010, and has been building ever since.</p> <p>The turning point happened when Mark started to write posts that were more authentic and had personality. Instead of finding his audience, Mark's audience found him. Mark tells new bloggers "To stand out, you need to be original. And to be original, you need to have the courage to tell your own story and have your own voice."</p> <p>In 2009 Mark wrote a post that was a little bit controversial, called The Social Media Country Club. As a new blogger, Mark felt like an outsider. He says it seemed like all of the influential bloggers were in this club, where they never said anything negative about each other. Mark was thinking, "How are we going to grow if we don't challenge each other?" Coming from 27 years of marketing experience, Mark expected any channel used for business to be measurable, while others felt it was all about the conversation. Though nervous, Mark started speaking his mind. The reaction was supportive and positive. His audience was grateful somebody finally said it.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what Mark blogged about at first and how he felt about it.</p> <p>Why marketing with content is so difficult today</p> <p>Whether you're an individual blogger, working in a business or working for a brand, many niches are getting crowded with content and social media activity. This makes it very difficult to compete.</p> <p>Mark feels this was predictable. He says when the Internet first started, everyone needed a website. If you were the first one with a website, you had an advantage. Then you needed to be found. If you were the first one to figure out search engine optimization, you had an advantage, because you're going to be at the top of the search rankings. However, after your competitors figured it out, it got harder and more expensive to be in marketing.</p> <p>He says it's the same thing with blogging. It's hard to be seen, because people are figuring it out. People are trying to stand out, but creating more or better content isn't necessarily the answer.</p> <p>For the last year, Mark has been obsessed with figuring out how to maneuver in this very crowded world. And that's why he wrote The Content Code.</p> Do you publish content online? Want more people to share your content? To learn how to get more people to share your content, I interview Mark Schaefer.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Influencer Marketing<br /> How Doug became interested in influencer marketing</p> <p>After Doug got out of the Navy in 1992, he started a newspaper and did direct and database marketing. Then about 12 years ago, he started a blog.</p> <p>From a database marketing standpoint, Doug shares he's always been intrigued by the pockets or the gaps, and not the averages. In the direct mail days, the motto was "go after a certain age group, gender and neighborhood, and get 100% saturation." Doug found, over time, it was the smaller pockets of people who had higher conversion rates.</p> <p>This is true in online marketing as well. People who do SEO optimize for huge keywords with massive search volumes. Maybe they rank, but they don't get any results (meaning business) out of it.</p> <p>Influencer marketing is the same, in that people go after influencers. They spend a lot of money without seeing results, because they make significant errors as they select and research influencers.</p> <p>Doug says he tells people who are transitioning from traditional to online media that he doesn't think a lot has changed. As marketers, it's all about building trust and satisfying clients.</p> <p>Blogging and social media are great for that, because customers can now talk to people at different companies and get insight into their business through these channels. You build relationships virtually, then get those people to convert.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear what opportunities came to Doug from blogging.</p> <p>How Doug defines influencer marketing</p> <p>Doug believes influencers are people within our industry who already have established trust with an audience.</p> <p>Let's say someone has an amazing audience you want to reach. The best way to get to that person's audience is to create an influencer marketing campaign and work with that influencer to help you promote your products and services.</p> <p>The keys are audience (find an influencer whose audience matches what you need) and reach. Determine if the influencer's reach is wide enough to make your campaign sensible from a time and money standpoint.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear examples of good influencers to reach out to in the marketing and social media space.</p> <p>The differences among reach, popularity and influence</p> <p>Doug says half of the time, a company fails because they focus on reach and popularity, but not necessarily on influence.</p> <p>Influence is not about retweets or shares. It's about conversions. If someone makes a purchase based on a person's advice, that person is an influencer.</p> <p>When Doug works with an influencer, he looks at that person's target audience to see whether he or she has captivated their trust and made sales to them. One of the telltale signs that influencers are doing well is they've had the same ...

In July 2013 we launched a website designed to help busy parents do fun activities with their kids. I shut it down a year and a couple months later.</p> <p>I learned when you launch something in a space that you do not have a lot of experience in, you need to do more research than I did.</p> <p>My research process prior to launching My Kids' Adventures included going to the library and to book stores and identifying popular blogs. While we made assumptions based on what we saw everyone else doing, we didn’t test whether our target audience (busy, working professionals) had the time to read, consume, do and share our content, even though they may have had the desire to do so.</p> <p>Ways to test these assumptions would have been to go to trade shows attended by my target audience and talk to them or do a joint survey with a big website in that space to gather data.</p> <p>One thing I learned was sometimes it’s better to go deep in a space where you are already successful than to try to go wide into a space where you don’t know anything.</p> <p>There are so many niches where people have developed some success. They hear the word pivot and decide to dive into something new. Instead of doing that, the better thing to do is figure out something new that still fits with your existing audience.</p> <p>The hardest thing in the world is to create an audience. And you can’t launch a product if you do not have an audience.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn the biggest mistake I made when I launched My Kids' Adventures. <br /> The Phases of a Product Launch<br /> The research and definition phase</p> <p>Whenever I get a new idea for a product, it starts with a spark in my brain. One of the first things I do is talk through my idea with people I trust to see whether or not my vision is crazy.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Joanna Wiebe, a copywriter, conversion expert and founder of CopyHackers.com--a website designed to help you improve your conversions.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Split Testing<br /> What led Joanna to copywriting and conversions</p> <p>Joanna says she fell into the field of copywriting. After leaving law school, she was looking for her next opportunity. When a friend who worked at an agency said they were looking for a writer, Joanna got the position, along with the title creative writer. (She thought copywriter sounded too boring.)</p> <p>A couple years later, Joanna went over to Intuit (makers of Turbo Tax) as senior copywriter. Once there, she says she finally figured out what copywriting was ... and understood that it was not boring!</p> <p>Joanna explains the difference between a creative writer and a copywriter. A creative writer is a person who is more likely to come up with tag lines and concepts for ads and campaigns. It's someone who abstracts a message from insights. On the other hand, from Joanna's experience a copywriter is more of a scientific writer. Copywriting is not about you. It's about listening to people who are potentially nothing like you to find the right message, she says.</p> <p>According to Joanna, split testing became more readily available eight or nine years ago, and testing tools, like Optimizely, VWO and Omniture (before it was acquired by Adobe), were starting to pop up. So the company started split testing different approaches to solving problems. They would test them using actual data: website visitors or email subscribers helped them test by voting with their clicks or their credit cards.</p> <p>This led Joanna to start Copy Hackers about three years ago.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how creativity stifled Joanna in her first position as a writer.</p> <p>The ad at the bottom of Copy Hackers</p> <p>To capture email addresses Joanna uses a solution called Bounce Exchange. They have been experimenting with ways to get people's attention.</p> <p>There’s a little guy in the corner of the website and it says “Click here to get a free guide.” It appears as you’re scrolling down the page. Once you click on it, it gives you the opt-in box.</p> <p>Bounce Exchange is software presented with a service, Joanna explains. For best results, you work with their creative team and they come up with variations. They split tested different content and "The Free 2015 Persuasion Guide" got the best response. Now they are testing different messaging for the guide, as well as ways to get people to opt-in.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what other content Joanna tested against the persuasion guide.</p> <p>The exit intent popup</p> <p>Exit intent means when the mouse moves up into a certain range to indicate someone is leaving your website. In this case, when the Copy Hackers' exit intent box appears, readers are given the choice. “Yes, get the free guide” or “No, I reject the persuasion guide. Do you split test the opt-ins on your website? Want to get better results? To learn how to create effective split tests, I interview conversion expert Joanna Wiebe.

So Jason quit, went back to school for training in SEO and digital marketing. He worked at a little startup called Market Tools, then Marketo and he's now at LinkedIn.</p> <p>Jason talks about his time at Marketo. He led global and content marketing and did the blog and the social channels himself when he first started. It was chaos, he recalls. Jason learned very quickly how to solve other marketers' problems and write about them, which is how he grew his blogging skills.</p> <p>"It was B2B marketing, which could be quite boring," Jason recalls. "I took what I call the George Costanza approach, where I do the exact opposite of what everybody else is doing."</p> <p>For example, if someone said to Jason that social media doesn't work in B2B, he would do the exact opposite and prove them wrong. After a tremendous amount of trial and error to find out what worked and scaling his content efforts, Jason was successful.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear the backstory for Welcome to the Funnel.</p> <p>Build relationships that tie into content</p> <p>Jason believes it's essential to include influencers in your marketing strategy, especially in your content.</p> <p>When you first start building your presence, seek out thought leaders in the space. Figure out how to take their wisdom and feature it in your content. You'll add third-party validation and keep from talking too much about yourself.</p> <p>At the same time, you also get on their radar. They know you're helping them spread the word and eventually you can find mutual benefit.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn how going to conferences helped Jason get into guest blogging. </p> <p>How to create sharable content that generates leads</p> <p>Jason believes we don't need more content, we need more relevant content.</p> <p>He has a concept he started at Marketo and brought over to LinkedIn called, "The Big Rock." Basically you need to ask yourself what conversation you want to own, and then write the book on it.</p> <p>Jason suggests going from thinking like a publisher to actually publishing like a publisher.</p> <p>When Jason first got to LinkedIn, the question was, "How do I market on LinkedIn successfully?" Since the conversation was being owned by others, Jason decided to take it back. He wrote a 65-page book called The Sophisticated Marketer's Guide to LinkedIn. It was everything you wanted to know about marketing on LinkedIn, written very strategically.</p> <p>It was broad-reaching content gated for the purpose of collecting email addresses. It was great for lead generation, Do you create content? Are you looking to generate more leads? To learn how to get the most from your content, I interview Jason Miller.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Video Blogging<br /> How Amy got involved with video</p> <p>Amy joined YouTube in March 2007. She was mostly an observer, and wanted to interact with others on the platform. In 2008, she started creating videos on her first YouTube channel. Amy enjoyed having a creative outlet where she could record and share experiences with her friends.</p> <p>When social media gained popularity, Amy looked at video differently. "I talked on Twitter to get to know people. I talked to a camera, so I could share that experience with those people. It was that simple," she recalls. "Then I started to realize there was a lot more to this story."</p> <p>In 2011 Amy began working independently. She used video to differentiate herself in the marketing space and started creating videos for her Savvy Sexy Social blog.</p> <p>Now, she has a camera set up in her office and a fun bookshelf background.</p> <p>Three times a week Amy talks via video to people who want to learn more about implementing social media for their brand and their business. Although she's made other fun videos, as well as videos for brands, she recently filmed her 400th episode for the Savvy Sexy Social blog.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Amy's opinion on which came first: social media or video.</p> <p>Facebook video vs. YouTube</p> <p>Amy believes linking to a YouTube video on Facebook has never been a good idea, because you need to customize the experience based on the platform. Although a YouTube link has never been visually pleasing on Facebook, there's always been a way to work around that.</p> <p>Now that Facebook is pushing their own organic video, the game is changing. If you have an audience on Facebook or are hoping to grow one, it's definitely something to consider.</p> <p>Amy wants people to watch her YouTube videos, but within a space she controls, which is her website. Usually when Amy posts to Facebook, it's a blog link with the video embedded on her site.</p> <p>However, since Facebook video will perform better than a link to a blog or a YouTube video, Amy suggests another option.</p> <p>Since Facebook video has a clear call-to-action button that you customize at the end, it's an excellent teaser opportunity. "If the first 30 seconds of the video are really interesting, then upload that to Facebook," she says. "Then, have the call to action at the end ask viewers to watch the rest of it on your website."</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what loyal YouTubers think about using Facebook video.</p> <p>Mistakes video marketers make</p> <p>"There's way too much green screen time going on," Amy says. To be a professional on video, you don't need a perfect backdrop. YouTube and other online video platforms are places to get to know someone personally, so relax. You can still have the level of prestige that your brand deserves without having a formal background.</p> <p>The beginning of the video is the most critical, Amy adds. Do you post videos?

She was happily making no money as an actor and theater producer in NYC before she took the plunge.</p> <p>Caitlin FitzGerald (who is now on Masters of Sex) played the lead in Hedda Gabler, a play Emily co-produced. She would come to the set with scripts for big indie films that had embarrassing and dismal parts for women. The largely female production group for the play would have drinks after the show, "rage against the state of women in cinema" and discuss doing something about it.</p> <p>At the time, Caitlin was making a movie called Newlyweds with well-known DIY filmmaker Ed Burns. Ed shot Newlyweds with a scaled-down crew for $9,000, made possible by the video capacity of D-SLR cameras.</p> <p>Emily recalls during one of their rage sessions in late 2010, Caitlin said, "Guys, we should make a movie. It's so easy. And I'll prove it to you."</p> <p>That was the beginning.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear what happened when Emily visited Caitlin on the Newlyweds set.</p> <p>How Emily crowdfunded her film</p> <p>Caitlin and Caroline von Kuhn, who wrote the script for their film Like the Water, did not write a mockumentary shot in downtown Manhattan like Newlyweds. They wrote a slow, contemplative indie drama about grief and friendship set in Maine in the summer.</p> <p>Since Emily's film was an entirely different scope, she learned quickly that it couldn't be shot for $9,000; their shooting budget was $85,000. Emily says they had raised $65,000 from a group they affectionately referred to as "friends, family and fools" and were looking at a $20,000 shortfall in spring 2011.</p> <p>httpv://youtu.be/PFDjGcLQaVk</p> <p>Most independent films are made by a group of friends getting together when everyone's schedules line up. This was also the case with Emily's film, so they had a very short window to find the rest of their funding. Pre-production through shooting was planned to take place from the middle of June to the beginning of August. It was May, and they had to find a way to communicate the importance of the film to their community and get the rest of the funding.</p> <p>Emily says it didn't take long for a bunch of women to land on a familiar message for people seeking to crowdfund projects: a wedding registry. At the time, Kickstarter and Indiegogo were new.</p> <p>They made a list of everything they needed: cameras, car rentals, bug spray, sunscreen, wardrobe, food, coffee and more. Emily typed it into a WordPress blog and put a PayPal link at the bottom. Then, the six of them sent it to everyone they knew. In 30 days, they'd raised $23,000 in cash and hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans and gifts of locations, goods and services.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Snapchat Marketing<br /> Why marketers use Snapchat</p> <p>Gary believes marketers need to be where people are paying attention. As a platform, Snapchat has the attention of 15- to 25-year-olds in America. If that's the demographic you're trying to reach, you need to be on Snapchat. A bonus of Snapchat is that the grounds are very fertile, Gary adds. It's so new, brands haven't "ruined it yet."</p> <p>According to Shaun, a lot of people think that since Snapchat content disappears, it's not valuable. He says that's not the case.</p> <p>On many social media platforms, viewers scroll through content quickly. And even though those posts will be there forever, viewers will never see it again. Marketers are only grasping for 50% of users' attention at a time, and those users never look back.</p> <p>Snapchat users can't look back. However, marketers have 100% of their audience's attention for the length of the content's life.</p> <p>Shaun explains that on Snapchat, you send out pictures or videos for a certain number of seconds (1 to 10). As the consumer, you absorb that content and then it disappears off your screen. Your never see it again, unless you screenshot the frame of a movie or a picture, which gets reposted.</p> <p>Gary believes the younger generation gravitates toward Snapchat, because parents have infiltrated Facebook and now Instagram. "Snapchat created a haven that parents didn't know about," Gary explains. "Plus, the content itself just disappeared. The holy grail for teenagers."</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Gary's 80s analogy for Snapchat.</p> <p>What marketers are doing on Snapchat</p> <p>Shaun uses Snapchat to involve and engage his fans in projects.</p> <p>For example, Shaun created a Jurasnap Park, playing off of Jurassic Park, full of all of his friends. He invited them to take a selfie, draw themselves into a dinosaur and send it to him. He then took screenshots and reposted all the dinosaur snaps of his fans for the world to see. They felt involved because it was a group project, rather than a project he just did on his own.</p> <p>Gary explains that what Shaun did with his Snapchat story is a way your business can interact with everyone who follows you, instead of just engaging one to one.</p> <p>Creative people think of stories in a linear sense, Gary shares. They put out 7 to 15 collections of images to tell a 150-second story instead of just one 10-second story. Depending on how you want to tell a story, Snapchat offers options. You can share a long narrative, like snapping your entire night at the Super Bowl, or just add one snap at a time. Snapchat has enormous creative potential if you understand context.</p> <p>Shaun created a platform for himself, Gary adds. Many people engage with Shaun because he gives back. Are you on Snapchat? Do you use it for marketing? To learn how to use Snapchat for your business, I interview Gary Vaynerchuk and Shaun McBride.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Christopher Penn, the VP of marketing technology at SHIFT Communications (a PR firm). He co-founded PodCamp with Chris Brogan and is co-host of the Marketing Over Coffee podcast. His brand-new book is Marketing Blue Belt: From Data Zero to Marketing Hero.</p> <p>Christopher will talk about how to use Google Analytics to improve your marketing.</p> <p>You'll discover how to set goals, and analyze and measure your data.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry. How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Google Analytics<br /> How Christopher got into data and analytics</p> <p>Christopher came into the marketing space through working in technology. In 2003 he joined a student loan company startup as the director of technology. In the startup world, you do many different jobs. Christopher explains that in addition to being the CIO and CTO, he ended up doing a lot of the marketing, data collection and reporting to stakeholders. Over time, he realized  he enjoyed the marketing more than running the technology.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Christopher used podcasting and social media to stand out from larger companies.</p> <p>The importance of analytics</p> <p>Christopher believes there's a perception that doing analytics is difficult and requires a math degree. However, he relates analytics to cooking. He says you don't need to be a professional chef to make a decent breakfast—you just need to follow the basic recipe. If you want to be a professional chef, that's a different story. You should have a culinary degree and years of experience.</p> <p>Data and analytics are the same way, Christopher explains. If you want to be able to intelligently report on what you're doing, it's relatively easy to get started. If you want to get super-sophisticated, you'll probably want a statistics background down the road.</p> <p>In terms of what's readily available, particularly for social media, there are four layers of measurement:</p> <p> The media layer with social tools and analytics about audience reach and engagement.<br /> The web layer, where after engaging on social media, someone interacts on your website.<br /> The middle layer is marketing automation, which is tracking engagement at an individual level.<br /> The bottom layer is your sales and CRM.</p> <p>Christopher believes the first step toward strategy is measurement and data. After you analyze the data, which is the art and science of telling what happened, then you need to derive insights from it. Once you determine why certain things happened, then you can figure out what to do next.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn why and how to use benchmarking on Google Analytics. </p> <p>Simple things marketers can do with Google Analytics</p> <p>Marketers need to start by defining goals and goal values in their analytics. That changes the application from "what happened" to "how it's impacting your business."</p> <p>For example, choose a goal, like newsletter signups. Then determine what dollar value you put on a newsletter subscriber (what a subscriber spends on your website). Once you do that, you'll start to see things like estimated revenue of traffic. This is the value of traffic coming from social media and search to your site.</p> <p>Before delving into specific features of the platform, Do you use Google Analytics?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Laura Fitton, co-author of Twitter for Dummies.

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Twitter for Business<br /> How Laura got into Twitter</p> <p>When Twitter first went big in April 2007, Laura was not immediately on board. Laura admits she even blogged about how stupid she thought Twitter was. The following month she gave it one more shot. Within 24 hours, Laura's opinion changed. She followed a bunch of fascinating people, and saw first-hand how Twitter makes you feel connected.</p> <p>Laura feels she got the hang of it within a month, went to her first Tweetup and the beginning of June put her Twitter handle on her business cards. She thought Twitter would be big.</p> <p>In 2008 she reached out to Wiley Publishing because she wanted to write a book that would break down why Twitter was taking off. She never finished that proposal. She did, however, make several friends at Wiley through Twitter. She reached out to one of them and asked who to talk to about her book. They were looking for someone to write Twitter for Dummies. A match was made.</p> <p>The first edition of Twitter for Dummies came out the same time Laura launched OneForty.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Laura came up with the name for Pistachio consulting and why she used it for Twitter.</p> <p>How to be successful on Twitter</p> <p>Laura hears a lot of the same questions about Twitter all the time: "How do I get more followers?" "What do I tweet about?" "What is the point of Twitter? What is the value for my business?"</p> <p>Laura believes people need to center everything they do on Twitter around who they want to read it. You need to figure out who the perfect customer is for your business and what they actually need.</p> <p>Start by writing a Twitter mission statement on your profile that addresses who the account is for and what value it delivers. Whenever you are deciding what to tweet, see if it fits your mission. The other great thing about a mission statement, Laura adds, is that it lets others simply articulate what your account is about, who should follow it and why.</p> <p>The key to being successful on Twitter is sharing the right information, whether it's your own links or other content. Laura adds that you can get away with a fair amount of self-promotion, if you provide information that helps people, especially the people who would make a good customer for you in the first place.</p> <p>In his book What Would Google Do?, Jeff Jarvis said, "Do what you do best and link to the rest. You can build a valuable Twitter account that shares hardly any original content if it’s extremely well curated."</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Social Media Examiner's Twitter mission statement. </p> <p>Businesses doing Twitter right</p> <p>Laura shares two personal Twitter experiences. One with Canada Goose Inc and another with Verizon. In both cases she had a specific customer-service need. With Verizon, she had a wire down on her street.

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I'll interview Seth Godin, author of 17 books, including Purple Cow, Permission Marketing and Tribes. He blogs every day on topics related to marketing, leadership and more. He also has an excellent podcast mini-series called Seth Godin's Startup School.</p> <p>Seth and I explore his latest book along with his thoughts on publishing and marketing books.</p> <p>You'll discover Seth's philosophy on writing, the importance he puts on blogging and more.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry. How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Book Marketing<br /> Seth's new book</p> <p>Seth's latest book is called, What to Do When It's Your Turn (and It's Always Your Turn). He explains that he usually comes up with the title early in the process, and then writes the book to go with it. However, in this case, the title came second to last.</p> <p>The book exists because when his son was heading off to college, he asked Seth to write down his advice. A letter to his son turned into a book for everyone. It's a heavily illustrated book about fear, bravery and doing work that matters.</p> <p>Seth's background is in publishing and he was a book packager for 12 years, during which time he and his team wrote 120 books. These included almanacs, books on gardening, business and everything in between.</p> <p>In 1999, he started writing books as a solo author. One person with a point of view. That's when things shifted for him, he says. "I didn’t say, 'What book do I need to write next, because I need to pay the bills?' I said, 'What do I care enough about saying to put myself through all the pain and suffering it takes to bring a book into the world?'</p> <p>Seth's first "real book" was Permission Marketing which has his picture on the cover.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why Seth believes all of his books are marketing books.</p> <p>How Seth decides what to write when it comes to his books</p> <p>Seth doesn’t think he has much say in what he chooses to write about. While he is very strategic in most elements of his life, his best writing is not strategic at all. "I start with an itch and the writing is my scratching of the itch," Seth reveals.</p> <p>He starts a new book every few days, and some of them only last a paragraph or two, which is why it’s great to have a blog. If a book won’t go away, then he has to write it.</p> <p>Seth believes most people shouldn’t look at the book business as a way to make a living. The book business is an organized hobby, and a fabulous way to bring ideas into the world and a great thing to leave behind.</p> <p>For those who want to write a book to become a paid, professional author, Seth says, don't. Instead, think about using books as a generous way to spread ideas and earn trust.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn why Seth doesn’t discuss upcoming projects with his peers.</p> <p>Why Seth decided to publish and distribute this book on his own</p> <p>Since most people don't finish the books on their Kindle, Seth wanted What to Do When It's Your Turn to be only available on paper. He also didn't want people to buy just one copy of the book.</p> <p>"If you buy 1 copy, I send you 2. If you buy 3 copies, I send you 5. If you buy 8 copies, I send you 12," he explains. "If you get an extra copy of a book, you have to give it away."</p> <p>Since ideas are now spreading person to person... Wondering how a master marketer thinks about books and the launch process?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Ian Cleary, the founder of RazorSocial, a marketing tech blog focused on social media tools. His blog has been awarded a top 10 social media blog by Social Media Examiner in 2013 and 2014. Ian is also a very popular speaker.</p> <p>Ian explores content curation, why it's valuable and tools that make the discovery of new content easy.</p> <p>You'll discover what content curation is, why it's important and how to find and share relevant content.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below.<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry. How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Content Curation<br /> Ian's journey</p> <p>After more than 15 years in technology, Ian started doing social media consultancy and training. He wanted an international business that combined his knowledge of tools, technology and social media, which led him to RazorSocial.</p> <p>Ian explains when he started the blog just over two years ago, he initially focused on guest blogging. Ian developed relationships with other people in the industry, seeking out opportunities to guest post on similar sites. It got his name out there and drove traffic to his site, which was the intent. He then had to make sure his site had really good content.</p> <p>Ian now has more than 100,000 visitors to the site every month. They run webinars and sell online training. Ian's primary focus is to still build relationships and provide quality content. "People are prepared to buy our premium content because they know we deliver good content all the time," he says.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear more about Ian's networking strategy and the story of how we first met.</p> <p>What is content curation?</p> <p>Ian believes that content curation is about finding relevant content and sharing it in a meaningful way. For example, if you do a weekly roundup post, don't just list article titles and links, instead add the reason why each post is interesting.</p> <p>Curated content can be your own articles, as well as posts from others. When Ian compiles his email newsletter, he'll put in his latest posts, but he also picks out some of his popular older articles, and points out why he thinks they would be valuable for his readers.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how Ian curates his own content. </p> <p>Why marketers should care about curating content</p> <p>Ian explains how content curation builds up a marketer's authority. If your audience trusts you because you consistently share good content, when you share your own material, they're more likely to engage.</p> <p>On the flip side, if you share consistently bad or irrelevant content from other sources, people won't be as interested when you share your own articles.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Social Media Examiner curates other people's content.</p> <p>Ian's content sharing strategy</p> <p>When Ian shares other people's content on Facebook and other social media platforms, he puts a line before the article link explaining what the article's about and why it's interesting.</p> <p>Ian also explains how he curates content for posts on his blog. For example, he recently did an article on podcast tools. He reached out to podcasters, and asked for their three favorite podcast tools. He compiled the response and wrote a summary.</p> <p>This type of post is both valuable and shareable. Do you curate content for your blog and social media sites?

How to subscribe/review on iPhone.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Advanced Facebook Ad Techniques<br /> New Facebook tools for content publishers</p> <p>Before going into detail about the four new features aimed at content publishers, Jon explains the difference between an organic post and a Facebook ad.</p> <p>An organic post is something you share with your fans that's free and will also show up in the news feed. If you want to promote a post or create a separate promotion, that's an ad.</p> <p>The first new feature is the ability to target organic posts by interest to your fans. Targeting interests was previously something you could only do with ads.</p> <p>Jon shares why a marketer might want to try targeting fans. Facebook's algorithm only shows content to people who are likely to engage. After these fans engage, Facebook will show it to more people. So, if you target a post to people you know are highly likely to engage, you'll get the benefit of more Facebook visibility.</p> <p>Note: You can target by demographics, as well as to fans of other pages and fans in specific categories.</p> <p>The next change, which has been rolled out to a small number of big media companies, is smart publishing. This is auto-publishing, based on user engagement. Facebook looks at the most popular links people share on Facebook, and will share them with your fans. It won't post on your fan page, it'll just appear in your fans' news feed.</p> <p>Third is post end date. If you share something that's going to expire, you can put a post end date. It will disappear from your page and the news feed when that promotion is over.</p> <p>You'll hear about the final update, which is improvements to domain insights.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Jon's take on dark data, as well as how to generate and use UTM codes to better track link engagement and conversions.</p> <p>How Facebook tracks conversions</p> <p>By default, Jon explains, Facebook records a conversion when somebody has clicked your ad and converted within 28 days or viewed your ad without clicking and converted within 1 day. However, if you use your custom reports, you can adjust that window. You can get rid of view-through, or you can set view-through and click-through conversions for 1 day, 7 days or 28 days.</p> <p>When you have that conversion pixel on your site, Facebook knows three things: whether someone viewed your ad, clicked your ad or if they ever fired that conversion pixel. Facebook uses these metrics to determine whether your ad resulted in a conversion.</p> <p>To get to custom reports, go into your Ads Manager and click on Reports. Then click on the Customized Columns button, and then in the bottom right-hand corner of the window, the Attribution Window pops up. This is what you change to include any or all six reporting options.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what happens to your view-through and click-through conversions when you targe...

Two tactics—books and podcasts—are the factors that made the difference. He noticed the audio version of his book Epic Content Marketing really took off, so he figured there must be something to audio.</p> <p>Joe shares how his and Robert Rose's podcast evolved. Joe recalls how once after their weekly phone call about what was going on in content marketing, he said, "We should have recorded that." Robert asked, "Why don't we?" They launched This Old Marketing the following week.</p> <p>Jay started podcasting in January 2012, and just finished the third season of his Social Pros podcast, which totals about 150 episodes.</p> <p>Jay explains that Tristin Handy, who was director of marketing at Argyle Social at the time, said, "Did you ever think about doing a podcast? We should do a podcast." And Jay thought, "No and okay." They got together and decided to create a show that paid attention to the unsung heroes of social media. Jay says it's grown far beyond the expectations he had for it at the beginning.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover which podcasts I listened to when I started the Social Media Marketing podcast.</p> <p>How podcasting helps their businesses</p> <p>When Joe looked at the behaviors of those who attend Content Marketing World, he realized his core customers engage in at least three different content vehicles, such as the newsletter, magazine and/or webinars. It's the third thing that's the tipping point, so he figured the audio content could be what gets people to the event.</p> <p>Jay says the Social Pros podcast allows them to spotlight their corporate clients, as well as interview potential future clients. Podcasting has become a strong lead-generation business strategy. It's also helped Jay from a personal branding and awareness perspective, because it positions him (and his company) as a leader in the field.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how podcasting builds customer loyalty.</p> <p>Their new ventures</p> <p>Joe's releasing a new book called Content Inc., which will be out in time for Content Marketing World in September. Rather than just doing a book, he's creating a platform.</p> <p>"If it's important enough to be a book, it's important enough to be a bigger media property," Joe explains. "You can launch an entire platform off of a podcast." The Content Inc. Have you considered starting a podcast? Would you like to discover how to use a podcast to grow your business?

It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>In this episode I interview Andrew Davis, author of Brandscaping: Unleashing the Power of Partnerships.

From there he freelanced as a producer for programs, such as the Today Show and Weekend Today. After the first dot-com boom, Andrew followed the path of some of his friends into the marketing world.</p> <p>While working at startups, Andrew realized that if you created great content, like television producers did, you actually would inspire people to buy stuff. He figured if he could apply those principles in the marketing world, he could really be successful.</p> <p>He then partnered with James Cosco, a journalist, who also went to BU. They started an agency called Tippingpoint Labs, and grew it until 2012, when Andrew sold his share in the business and wrote Brandscaping. Andrew has since been traveling the world, speaking and helping people find the right kinds of partnerships and rethink marketing.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear about Andrew's background as a producer, and how the skills he developed prepared him for work in marketing.</p> <p>The meaning of brandscaping</p> <p>Andrew says that brandscaping is leveraging the audiences of others for the benefit of both partners.</p> <p>In the digital age everybody has an audience, whether it's on social media or through email. If you partner with other brands and create valuable content that they would want to proactively send to their audience, then there is no need to buy access to the media.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how our podcast is a brandscape. </p> <p>The benefits of partnering</p> <p>Andrew explains that there are three simple benefits to partnering: it's better, faster and cheaper.</p> <p> It's better. As marketers, we can create better content if we're willing to partner with others who know the audience perhaps even better than we do.<br /> It's faster. Most content marketing is a slow-grow strategy. But brands that partner with other brands see much more rapid success with the content they create.<br /> It's cheaper. It's much less expensive to share with other audiences than it is to advertise.</p> <p>If you're nervous about partnering with a brand, Andrew suggests you find a person who is a known talent and who already has access to your audience.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how to partner with talent.</p> <p>Examples of content collaborations</p> <p>Andrew shares examples of some great marketing partnerships.</p> <p>When Converse (the athletic shoe company) was trying to rebuild their brand, their CMO Geoff Cottrill realized they got the most traction when celebrities wore their shoes and they ended up in a magazine. Since it was too expensive to buy access to celebs, Geoff figured they should look for the next big thing. Do you create great content other businesses might find interesting? Have you considered collaborating with other brands?

It's become a visual search engine for products and can link items together based on how they've been previously pinned or searched.</p> <p>Vincent shares how many people bypass Google and go directly to Pinterest to search for products and lifestyle topics because the content is curated by actual users and the results tend to be high quality.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Pinterest's visual recognition engine links related products to be searched and discovered.</p> <p>The biggest mistakes people make on Pinterest</p> <p>The biggest mistake businesses make on Pinterest is neglecting to redirect the source of a pin back to their site.

Lewis said, "Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement." As we fail, we are pointed in a direction. We learn a lot from failures because they can help us get better.</p> <p>We focus so much on success stories and what works that we often overlook the unmentioned road of failure, challenges, errors and mistakes that inevitably led to every single one of those success stories.</p> <p>In 2014, I had a really big failure. In fact, it was my biggest failure ever. Many people don't know about it and this show is the first time I've spoken about it publicly. I would like to share what went wrong, the lessons I learned and the importance of failure to your business, marketing and life.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why failure is so important to your business and life.</p> <p>The importance of failure and reasons to embrace it</p> <p>Henry Ford offers this great quote: "The only real mistake is the one from which we learn nothing." The path that we go down is meant to have challenges and mistakes. It's what strengthens us and makes us better.</p> <p>Here are three reasons you should embrace failure:</p> <p>1. It's part of the entrepreneur's journey. Whether or not you consider yourself an entrepreneur or business owner, this lesson applies to everyone. Nearly every definition of "entrepreneur" focuses on the word risk. Risk is at the core of all business breakthroughs and success.</p> <p>With risk comes failure. It's inevitable and it's okay.</p> <p>2. Nothing ventured. Nothing gained. If you're not willing to float a new idea for your company, experiment with your marketing or launch a new venture, the opportunity that sits in front of that idea will never manifest. It will never come true. You'll never really grow.</p> <p>Social Media Examiner is my third major business venture in the last 18 years. It followed a design agency and a white paper writing consultancy, both of which were very successful and have since shut down.</p> <p>In 2009, I started the media company which you now know as Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>Along the way, I tried and failed at a lot of things. You'll hear four examples of my terrible failures, and why I didn't let these failures stop me or get me down.</p> <p>3. New discoveries are born in the ashes of failure. The most important reason to embrace failure is that it makes way for new opportunities to grow into awesome things. There's no better time than right after you crash and burn to reflect on what you've done wrong and really learn from it.</p> <p>I love this quote from Zig Ziglar: "It's not how far you fall, but how high you bounce that counts." You have to try, experiment, fail and do it over and over again.</p> <p>In summary, failure is a necessary part of the process of making new discoveries.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how two of America's most famous businessmen never gave up on their discoveries and why th...

It's about providing content-driven experiences that are educational, entertaining or useful to your audience, but ultimately drive engagement, awareness and sales for your brand.</p> <p>Social media gives you the power to aggregate your own audiences and be your own media company. The tools needed to publish the type of content that establishes you as a thought leader in your industry and draws customers to your brand are readily available and easy to use.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how content marketing can go beyond written articles and encompass things like videos, app development, games and more.</p> <p>Examples of businesses that do content marketing well</p> <p>You'll hear Robert explore how big companies like Chipotle Mexican Grill, LEGO and Coca-Cola leverage content marketing in creative and innovative ways such as movies, TV series and magazines.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBhTiyQU1kA</p> <p>Compared to what large companies might spend on traditional mass media or big sponsorships, their content marketing expenditures are just a drop in the bucket, according to Robert—yet it has such a big impact from a branding standpoint.</p> <p>Even if your small business doesn't have the budget for national TV spots and large print campaigns, you can get a lot of bang for your buck through content marketing. It's easy and inexpensive to publish, distribute and promote your own content through blogging, social media and podcasting.</p> <p>Robert uses Marcus Sheridan's business blog to illustrate this point.

Visuals are a snackable way to express ideas.</p> <p>Visuals are a huge part of social media and they continue to evolve. People are so busy today. Images catch their attention and are quicker and easier to process than text as they scroll through a social media feed.</p> <p>Beyond leveraging social media platforms typically known to be visual (Pinterest and Instagram), Kim also looks for ways to implement visuals and eye-popping graphics in her Twitter content strategy and on her blog.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover more ways to leverage visual content in your social media marketing. </p> <p>The importance of visuals for social media marketing </p> <p>From a social media marketing standpoint, the old saying that "a picture's worth a thousand words" holds so much value today. As marketers, we all need to be or become storytellers. A great photo or graphic tells a story in one hot second.</p> <p>We live in such an information-overloaded space right now and attention spans are so short. Text-based marketing alone has become less and less effective.</p> <p>The brain processes visuals 60,000 times faster than text. A good image can connect an idea or message much quicker and stronger than text-only content.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out other amazing stats for the effectiveness of visual content on what your audience will process, learn and retain. </p> <p>Different types of visuals you can create </p> <p>There are five primary types of visual content you can create for social media: videos, photos, creative images, infographics and slide shows. Kim explains that comics, memes and infographics tend to be hugely popular on social media.</p> <p>Comics and memes are a way to showcase humor. They're fun and relatable, so people are eager to share them with their friends and family.</p> <p>According to Kim, businesses that use infographics probably have a 12% higher growth rate than companies that don't. Infographics offer a visual way to share a lot of interesting content in one image. People love them too.</p> <p>The most popular place to get more bang from your infographics is on Pinterest. People share them there like mad. Another great place to leverage infographics is on blogs.</p> <p>An infographic doesn't necessarily have to be complex to be appealing and effective.

A few months ago, Instagram bought Hyperlapse, an app that allows you to create time-lapse videos and share them on Instagram.</p> <p>Hyperlapse is simple and fun to use. It speeds up the frames 3, 6 or 12 times and gives the feeling of moving really quickly through physical space, which is interesting and different to see in your Instagram feed.</p> <p>The advantage of Hyperlapse is it can absolutely get someone to stop in their Instagram tracks while they scroll through their feed. It also makes it possible for you to compress a longer video into the allotted 15 seconds for video on Instagram.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover a new trick with hashtags you can use to get your posts to the top of Instagram's hashtag curation. </p> <p>Promote conferences and events with Instagram</p> <p>Instagram is the best way to connect with and grow your community at events and conferences.

It's available forever and can easily be found with the hashtag.</p> <p>Even if you miss a chance to meet someone in person at an event, you can still reach out to him or her on Instagram afterwards.

What an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation!</p> <p>Paul discovered that Stew Leonard's does a great job connecting with people and that they built sociability into their business from the very beginning. He felt like he was truly part of a special experience when he was in the store.</p> <p>There are some fairly consistent things, particularly in the age of social media, that companies should do to take advantage of this level of brand affinity. People love to share.</p> <p>When people discover something that they think might help someone else, they really want to share it. If you can figure out why your customers would recommend your brand, you have great ability to help them to do it.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what businesses should consistently do to become highly recommended. </p> <p>The power of online recommendations</p> <p>Online recommendations have a dramatic influence and a bigger reach than face-to-face recommendations. Word-of-mouth recommendations have always been the Holy Grail for marketers. Social media basically puts that power on steroids.</p> <p>Now when someone says something positive about your brand, that endorsement has the potential for reaching millions of people.</p> <p>Paul describes two types of recommendations: implied or explicit. An explicit recommendation is told directly in person, through a post or from an online review that something is great. An implied recommendation can be as subtle as liking a Facebook page or sharing a post, yet it can be just as powerful and influential, depending on the source.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how recommendations, even from complete strangers, can drive people to your product or brand. </p> <p>What drives recommendations</p> <p>There are many reasons people are eager to accept and offer recommendations.

He helps brands figure out why humans do what they do. His particular area of interest is to capture the opinions and study the behavior of people out of their homes and on the go.</p> <p>For Tom, understanding mobile marketing goes beyond the technology. It's about being able to understand people's needs, wants, and desires while they are in transition, out and about, and away from home.</p> <p>This idea was the impetus behind his new book, The Mobile Commerce Revolution: Business Success in a Wireless World</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn how it's been possible for Tom's company, Edison Research, to study mobile behavior for decades. </p> <p>What is the mobile commerce revolution</p> <p>Every year, experts in various trades are asked if this is going to be the year of mobile when, in fact, the year of mobile has already happened. According to Tom, the mobile commerce revolution is already upon us.</p> <p>You'll hear Tom describe the Starbucks mobile app as an example of how much consumer behavior has already been shaped by mobile.</p> <p>There's no special technology to the Starbucks mobile app. It's nothing more than a bar code on your phone that's tied to a method of payment. Yet it's eliminated the need for a wallet and made it simpler to purchase items using something Starbucks customers already have in hand: their smartphones.</p> <p>The use of this smartphone app has become such default behavior that it’s prompted customers to make a purchase at Starbucks when they otherwise might not have.</p> <p>If you base your mobile strategy on the technology, then you will not make it. Mobile isn't about technology.

However, the first step when you develop a successful mobile strategy is to examine human behavior.</p> <p>Tom describes the mobile web as having three distinct eras. We've moved past the first two eras of optimizing for mobile and responsive design.

Mark immersed himself in Twitter 7 years ago, when he started his own consulting business and started to teach.</p> <p>Mark admits that he was not an early fan of Twitter. It took him months to figure out that this platform was more than just the advertising, technology, mentions or hashtags. Once he understood the powerful human aspect behind Twitter, it changed his life and he wanted others to understand it too.</p> <p>Mark calls Twitter the greatest networking tool ever created. Many of the connections he's made around the world would not have been possible without Twitter and his blog.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover more about Twitter's powerful ability to connect you with potential clients and opportunities. </p> <p>The three elements of the Tao of Twitter</p> <p>Mark identifies tao as the Chinese word meaning path.

It offers users the ability to target an audience down to a specific zip code, sentiment, or keyword.</p> <p>Twitter's Advanced Search allows you to find potential clients, conduct competitive research, track trends, or provide customer service, all in real-time.</p> <p>Mark explores the benefits of paid promotions and ads on Twitter.</p> <p>According to Mark, this is a great time to try Twitter advertising. The inventory is high and the cost is relatively inexpensive at the moment, but Mark projects that this may not be case for long, as more people learn to leverage this opportunity.</p> Do you use Twitter for your business?

Once he saw LinkedIn's viability in developing business clients and recruiting candidates, he started "running down that street like there was no tomorrow," as he put it.</p> <p>Many years later, LinkedIn considers Ron to be one of their top 1.5% of people with a large network, as well as one of their top 15% in terms of using the platform strategically.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Ron went from using LinkedIn to recruit talent to teaching other people how to successfully use LinkedIn. </p> <p>Why it's important for marketers and business owners to have a well-developed LinkedIn profile</p> <p>A lot of people approach LinkedIn as just a place for job-seekers and treat their profile just like a resume, which is a flat, two-dimensional experience.

First of all, it was a great experiment. I didn't even know if someone like me, who knew absolutely nothing about social media, could even start a blog and become a leader in this space. I actually call Social Media Examiner an online magazine.</p> <p>In 2008/2009, when I was exploring this idea, I did notice that not a lot of people were talking about the "how" of social media. It was more about "What's wrong with social media?" or "Why should I consider social media?" It was the "how" stuff that was really popular.</p> <p>One of the first things I noticed was that the articles detailing the how-to stuff were going crazy-viral on social.</p> <p>You'll hear two examples of articles that I wrote for Copyblogger and Marketing Profs. Those articles turned out to be two of the most popular articles written on those sites.</p> <p>It was the response to those two articles that drove me to start Social Media Examiner almost 5 years ago to the day. Little did I know then that a million+ people a month would consume our content today. It's hard to believe that it's been 5 years.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out the type of approach I took when it came to writing the articles for Copyblogger and Marketing Profs.</p> <p>Where the idea for Social Media Examiner came from</p> <p>It all started when I contacted Ann Handley, chief content officer at Marketing Profs, to ask if she wanted to connect on LinkedIn. Her response was, "Are you on Facebook?" At that time I thought Facebook was just for college students. This was probably in 2008 or early 2009.</p> <p>So I opened a Facebook account, and started to notice that there was a whole new community of people, not just students, who were having a great time on there. This opened my eyes to what could possibly happen. It was where it all started, I guess.</p> <p>Every idea has a genesis point, if you will, and that genesis moment was when Ann said, "How about Facebook?"</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how the name Social Media Examiner came about.</p> <p>The business strategy behind growing Social Media Examiner</p> <p>Before the launch of Social Media Examiner, I put together an online event under my White Paper Source brand. I called the event Social Media Success Summit. This was to see if a segment of my White Paper Source audience would be interested in social. This month is actually our 6th annual Social Media Success Summit.</p> <p>The success of this first summit made me decide to run the idea of Social Media Examiner by several of the presenters.</p> <p>The first summit included Mari Smith, Denise Wakeman and Chris Garrett, who all helped me put on this online conference.</p> <p>The idea behind Social Media Examiner was for me to write one article a week. Then I would recruit the others mentioned above to write one article a week. Have you ever wondered how Social Media Examiner started?

So about four years ago, he pulled the plug on the TV show and then took some time to figure out his next step.</p> <p>He started to teach, dabbled on YouTube and did a radio show. Then at a conference two years ago in Victoria, he met Mari Smith, who introduced him to the world of Internet marketing and showed him how to build a community.</p> <p>Steve took her advice and added his own approach. About a year ago, he really started focusing on YouTube.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how last year's YouTube/Google+ changes were key for community development.</p> <p>Steve's show format</p> <p>Steve's how-to series shows his viewers how to use tech tools—from Google functions to iPhone apps—more effectively. Steve says if you watch an episode and say, "I didn't know I could do that," "I'd like to do that" or "I should be doing that," then he's done his job.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePVkSfKeEfI</p> <p>Most of Steve's videos are between 5 and 12 minutes long, which is a little long by conventional YouTube wisdom. His goal is to take on a topic and teach his viewers something they probably didn't know. Bottom line, he explains, is edutainment value.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear an example of something Steve teaches during an episode.</p> <p>Why you should start a YouTube show</p> <p>Steve feels that for many different topics it's easier to convey a concept with inflection through video than on other platforms.</p> <p>It's also a relaxing environment to browse through and discover information. Steve says most people will binge-watch YouTube. They'll watch several videos in a row on the same topic to learn something.</p> <p>A video is easier to follow than a blog, it's more engaging than a podcast and you can bring all of the media types together, Steve believes.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how Steve feels about writing.</p> <p>What tech Steve uses for his show and why</p> <p>Steve sets his broadcasts up as screencasts, but uses an app so viewers can also see his face as he explains the tech.</p> <p>The why: Content creates a connection between the presenter and viewer. Whether it's a blog, podcast or YouTube video, there is an intimate relationship between you, the speaker, and the audience. With the vastness of the Internet, Do you post videos on YouTube? Are you looking for ways to increase your traffic and subscribers?

He authored the book ProBlogger and founded two popular blogs: Digital Photography School and ProBlogger. Darren has been blogging since 2002 and his work has inspired millions of people.</p> <p>Darren shares how he built a mega-blog with millions of monthly readers.</p> <p>You'll discover how to attract more readers, engage your audience and monetize your blog.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Advanced Blogging<br /> How Darren started blogging</p> <p>In 2002 Darren came across a blog for the first time and knew right away it was a medium he wanted to explore. Almost immediately, he started his first blog.</p> <p>Darren explains that he had no background in technology or writing, just a fascination with community and communication.</p> <p>He developed an audience for his personal blog over the next year and a half, writing about a variety of niche topics (photography, spirituality, movies, politics). When his audience "complained" that there was too much variety, Darren split the topics up into different blogs.</p> <p>From there, Darren began to experiment with making money from blogging. It evolved from a hobby into a part-time job, then grew into a full-time business.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how many blogs Darren launched over the years.</p> <p>Why it's never too late to start blogging</p> <p>When Darren first started blogging, he looked at the big bloggers and thought he was too late to start. At that point, the big names had only been blogging for a year or two. However, Darren says new bloggers are breaking through all the time.</p> <p>More blogs mean greater opportunities to network and the ability to grow faster, especially if you can get on the radar of an influencer in your niche.</p> <p>While there may be a ton of bloggers out there, Darren explains that there's nobody who has your exact set of experiences, opinions, stories, skills and perspectives, and that's what sets you apart. If you can harness your uniqueness, there's certainly a way to get noticed.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how blogging in your niche will serve you well now and in the future.</p> <p>Digital Photography School, then and now</p> <p>Darren started Digital Photography School in 2006. It evolved from one of his previous blogs—a digital camera review blog. It was quite profitable, Darren explains, but not particularly satisfying. He wanted a blog about photography that he enjoyed writing—where he could build a relationship with his readers and answer common photography questions.</p> <p>When the site launched, Darren wrote all of the blog content himself (two to three posts per week), focusing on evergreen content and throwing shareable content into the mix. It was on a free theme, boot strapped, and gradually began to rank in Google and develop a following. He monetized using AdSense and Amazon affiliate marketing.</p> <p>A photography enthusiast, Darren says he's the guy in your circle of friends who people ask to photograph parties because they can't afford a real photographer. He's also the one everyone comes to before they buy a camera.</p> Do you have a blog for your business? Are you ready to take your blogging to the next level?

Companies of all sizes, as well as entrepreneurs, use them because they generate more sales than any other online marketing strategy.</p> <p>Social media helps you get your information out there, connect with your audience, get feedback, build relationships and more. However, tweets and Facebook posts don't usually result in a huge number of instant sales.</p> <p>A webinar, however, gets you in front of a captive audience that's interested in learning what you have to share for an extended period of time. It's more than just a quick message, post, article, picture or video. It's an interactive way to connect, build trust and make sales sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Most webinars are free. Then at the end, you can refer them to your solution, product, coaching or live event. You can convert in a more effective way than by just using social.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how webinar tools have changed.</p> <p>What tech you need</p> <p>Lewis recommends GoToWebinar, because he feels it's the most consistent. Plus, it's the standard format most marketers are used to.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMbufbv1f2c</p> <p>Other platforms to explore include Adobe Connect, Google Hangouts, Ustream, Livestream and WebinarJam.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear about the webinar tools we use at Social Media Examiner: GoToWebinar and WebEx.</p> <p>How to get people to register for a webinar</p> <p>Lewis suggests you start by promoting your webinar to your email list, and then encourage those who register to promote it for you. For example, on the post-registration thank-you page, put up a video or some text and ask registrants to share it on Facebook or Twitter.</p> <p>To make this easier, there are tools you can use such as the WP Sharely plugin or create a pre-populated Tweet button through ClicktoTweet.com.</p> <p>Another way to generate leads is to partner with others.</p> <p>Lewis talks about how he does affiliate webinars where people in a similar marketing space promote his information to their audience. He'll do a webinar with free content, offer his product or service and then give a 50% commission to that affiliate. You're paying someone to generate leads for you.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear the results of a successful affiliate marketing webinar.</p> <p>Optimizing the registration process</p> <p>Lewis likes to use LeadPages templates for his webinar registrations.</p> <p>He'll create three different registration templates: one with a simple image, Do you use webinars in your marketing?

So she wrote it!</p> <p>Ann wrote her first book, Content Rules, four years ago with C.C. Chapman. That was the beginning of the conversation about content marketing. These days, she explains, being able to write well is a necessity.</p> <p>Everybody Writes came out of Ann’s love for good writing and her desire to see marketers do a better job with their content.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn more about Ann's first book, Content Rules.</p> <p>Why the written word is so important to marketers</p> <p>Ann explains that since we're all publishers in this age of technology, our words become our ambassadors. Our writing conveys a lot of things about us. It can make us seem warm, fun, competent and trustworthy. But it can also make us seem boring, humdrum and confused.</p> <p>Choosing the right words to tell our story is really important, especially when you want to connect with your customers. In a world where we all have a platform, whether it's a blog or a website, words matter now more than ever.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear what people said to Ann when she told them she was writing a book on writing.</p> <p>What non-writers need to know about writing</p> <p>Ann believes we are all writers. If you have a website, work in marketing or post on social media, you're a writer. To learn to craft better content, just develop the necessary writing muscles.</p> <p>Ann talks about a story she tells in the book. As a non-athlete, she could never do a pull-up or a push-up. About a year ago, Ann started working with a personal trainer and then four months ago, she did a push-up. It's just like writing. If you want to get better at writing, or at push-ups, you just need practice.</p> <p>Everyone is capable of becoming a better writer.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what keeps people from believing they can write.</p> <p>How to develop writing muscles</p> <p>To get better at writing, you need to make it a priority. One tip Ann emphasizes is to give yourself permission to write badly and then fix what you've written. The main thing with writing content is to start somewhere. Write anything, and then edit it well.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what voice-to-text tools you can use to create early drafts of your content.</p> Do you write content for your business?

He ended up getting a job and staying.</p> <p>After four years, he returned to the U.S. and was working in advertising doing campaigns for celebrity perfumes when he realized he'd left a brand he loved—Australia and travel.</p> <p>For the next two years, Jesse spent time on SlideShare doing things like You Suck at PowerPoint.</p> <p>During that time he also put up proposals for people to send him money to attend festivals like SXSW and Cannes Lion in exchange for his notes and photos. Jesse says that gave him a good foundation for how to build community.</p> <p>When he saw a job open up for social media manager at Tourism Australia, he sent his résumé, but he knew he needed to do something more. He put his résumé on SlideShare that night and the next morning, it had 40k views and a lot of supportive comments.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Twitter helped Jesse get his résumé into the hands of Tourism Australia's managing director.</p> <p>What Tourism Australia's job is and how promoting tourism has changed</p> <p>Jesse explains that Tourism Australia is basically the marketing agency for tourism in Australia. His team promotes tourism to the country as a whole and also works with the different states and international offices.</p> <p>He says that advocacy and word-of-mouth have always played a role in promoting any industry, especially travel. Tourism Australia had started a Facebook page before he joined the organization; however, it took them three years to hit 1M fans.</p> <p>Jesse shares that he took a look at what had already been done and made the decision to launch Instagram, Google+ and Twitter as well and he's ramped it up ever since.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Jesse views the return on social media for Tourism Australia.</p> <p>The strategy behind Tourism Australia's social media</p> <p>Jesse's social media strategy has a couple of components.</p> <p>He says the first component is to build something that gets bigger over time. Jesse explains that in traditional advertising, the work tends to focus on big campaigns that you work on for 6 months, then launch. His approach for Tourism Australia is different. His team works on the small things that add value every single day.</p> <p>As an example, he explains that instead of running a big campaign or contest to grow Instagram quickly, Do you want your fans to help market you?

He shares that he decided to try the platform for 30 days. During that time, he made a Vine a day based around silly ideas he and his roommate came up with. Each 7-second Vine featured a special effect and in 30 days, Zach says he accumulated 200,000 followers.

He says the promise of social media analytics has a lot of misconceptions around it.</p> <p>With easy access to data on trending content, followers, Klout scores, etc., businesses are trying to find a way to use the data. Lutz explains why this approach often leads to a negative outcome and why businesses should approach using data with a goal or question first.</p> <p>Lutz shares why it's important to understand how a metric is built and points to the Influencer metric as an example. He says that while there are at least 10 different Influencer metrics that have to do with reach, not every influencer can help fulfill every goal.</p> <p>He explains why he would consider Social Media Examiner an influencer if he wanted to put a new social tool in front of people who work with social media, but not if he wanted to sell clothing.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn what influencer reach must be combined with to move people from awareness to intention.</p> <p>The difference between viral and contagious content</p> <p>Lutz says the term viral, when used to describe social media content, is wrong because something that's viral is equally infectious at every stage. For example, a story that is liked by 1 in 10 people the first time it's seen will be liked by 1 in 10 people in the future.</p> <p>He explains that when something is contagious, it gains weight as long as it travels. The more people who believe in it, the more trustworthy the story becomes, regardless of whether it's true.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how people convince an algorithm that something is contagious and how that's affected things like the New York Times Bestseller List.</p> <p>How social media data can empower a business</p> <p>Lutz states there isn't good or bad data, there's just useful and useless data. He explains that data is only useful when a business has the right question.</p> <p>He shares that many organizations start by asking what data they have and how they can measure it. Then they try to find something in the data to help their business.</p> <p>Lutz says you need to start with a question or goal, and then figure out how to capture the data that will help answer that question instead of using data to come up with a question you didn't have in the first place.</p> <p>He illustrates how a sales department can use data to answer the question, "How can we find new clients?"</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why sentiment is...

Because he was in the service business, he had this idea for making something once and selling it. He shares that what he really knew all about was not law or computers, but Disney World.</p> <p>In 2002, Lou gave himself a personal challenge. He wanted to write a book, get it published and get it validated by somebody. When the book came out, he thought that was the end of it. But his two-page brochure website turned into articles, which turned into a thriving discussion forum.</p> <p>In 2005, Lou realized podcasting was more powerful than anything he could write. That's when he started podcasting, doing videos, creating other products, doing events, etc. He's been doing this full-time since 2007.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn how Lou found a publisher to work with.</p> <p>How Lou moved from the book to the blog</p> <p>When he started the book, he was on things like Usenet news groups and early discussion forums. He says this showed him there was a community of people out there interested in Disney in the same way he was.</p> <p>Because he was responding to so many similar emails, he decided to write the responses as articles (which is what blog posts were back in 2003). He also created a discussion forum on his site; 29 people signed up on the first night! That number organically grew from 29 to 1,000 to 5,000 to 10,000 to 50,000 and the community is still going strong.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what Lou built his discussion forum on.</p> <p>How building his community led to the podcast</p> <p>Lou says he started working on his second book the day after his first book came out. His community was very active and he shares that in 2005 he started hearing about podcasting and how anyone could use podcasting to broadcast their message.</p> <p>He shares that he started without knowing what he was doing and if or how people would find the show. Within the first week, the podcast had a few hundred downloads then a few thousand. Lou believes this is because people interested in Disney were and still are hungry for content.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Lou's experience moving from the first wave of interest in podcasts into the second wave of interest.</p> <p>When the podcast turned from hobby to profession</p> <p>While Lou had things like AdSense and affiliate programs making some money on his websi...

When she told her agent she wanted to pitch a book about goal-setting and focus instead of a fitness book, he told her she didn't have the social media following or the credibility to write that type of book. </p> <p>She got to work and spent a year using social media to build a platform with the intention of writing the book she wanted to pitch to publishers in New York.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Chalene used social media when she first started.</p> <p>What Chalene built to support her book pitch</p> <p>Chalene shares that she had a ton of followers on YouTube and had just started a Facebook page when she decided to write Push. Even though she had millions of DVD customers, her agent had to remind her that publishers don't care who you know; publishers want to know if you have the ability to reach those people.</p> <p>To build her email list, Chalene created a 30-Day Challenge for her Facebook audience.</p> <p>She started with three quick videos to show how she uses her phone to organize her daily to-do list and included a simple email opt-in. Every day she delivered a 2-minute video to her email subscribers.</p> <p>The list grew to 100,000 in 9 months.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Chalene collected emails from her subscribers.</p> <p>How Chalene got started with Instagram</p> <p>After successfully using Facebook to build her email list, Chalene says she was able to land the publishing deal she wanted and the book was released in December 2011. Then she noticed she wasn't getting any love on Facebook.</p> <p>She didn't want to learn about Facebook ads and shares that she kind of picked up her toys and stomped off the playground. That's when she began to realize her kids were all over Instagram but businesses weren't.</p> <p>In winter 2012, Chalene decided to become an early settler on Instagram. She started with life-casting, sharing personal images to show where she was and what she was doing during the day.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how following a favorite fashion icon drastically changed Chalene's Instagram strategy.</p> <p>How Instagram has changed Chalene's business</p> <p>Chalene shares that as a business owner and someone with a family, Instagram saves her time. She says instead of spending hours creating content, she can now spend literally 15 seconds and produce content to drive traffic to an opt-in for current or future offers.</p> <p>Unlike Facebook, Do you want to grow your business using Instagram?

You'll also find out what worked for us and what didn't.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Launching With Social<br /> Start the launch process</p> <p>The first thing I did was to prepare a PowerPoint presentation for people on the internal team. If you're a one person show, you can prepare the same ideas and present them to a friend or even to yourself. What's important is to go through the process below.</p> <p>First you need to identify the audience you want to target. As part of the annual survey for Social Media Examiner and My Kids' Adventures, we asked two questions.: "Do you listen to podcasts?" and "Are you a mom or a dad?". Based on the responses we were able to determine that dads listen to podcasts more than moms which helped us to resize our expectations.</p> <p>You then need to identify your biggest asset. Whenever you launch anything, you should use what I call tag-along marketing. You've built an audience somewhere - with a blog, a newsletter, an existing podcast. This asset you own is there for you to use. Piggyback some of the marketing efforts for your new venture on it. My biggest asset was the Social Media Marketing podcast.</p> <p>Next take a look at who you're up against. I looked at the Kids & Family category and identified Sesame Street, Adventures in Odyssey and other podcasts from established brands that have been around forever as competitors.</p> <p>You need to establish what your product is all about. To wrap everyone's heads around Parenting Adventures, I simply shared that it's a 30 minute interview show followed by a fun activity.</p> <p>Then choose your launch date. The Parenting Adventures podcast launched on Friday, June 13, 2014.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why this date was chosen to launch the Parenting Adventures podcast.</p> <p>Find the best way to launch</p> <p>One of my strongest assets are the relationships we've built. From these relationships, I was able to identify different "camps" of people we could reach out to for their support.</p> <p>One of the obvious camps was staff and contractors who work for our company. For the second camp, we identified allies from the bloggers and podcasters the My Kids' Adventures marketing team has been building relationships with for a year. Another camp included people who write for My Kids' Adventures and the last camp was made up of my personal friends.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out other things we had in the launch pipeline.</p> <p>Leverage your website traffic</p> <p>When people come to your website to read an article, they might discover you have something more to offer.</p> <p>We added the Parenting Adventures podcast to the website navigation bar at the top of the page, to the sidebar and the About Us page.</p> <p>I also put together a 'help us spread the word' page to give people everything they need to promote the show for us. On that page I included a video to thank people for their participation.</p> Are you planning to launch a new blog, product or service?

While the page was mildly successful, it wasn't driving any traffic.</p> <p>Even though the page had shown prior growth, it had been sitting at 10K-13K fans for 18 months. In early October 2013, Rachel set a goal of getting to 50K fans by Christmas to support the spring launch of their book, 101 Kids Activities That Are the Bestest, Funnest Ever!, and started to post to the page more frequently.</p> <p>She says they noticed that a competing Facebook page with a huge audience was posting content from the Kids Activities Blog without providing a link back or attribution—the page was even cropping the watermarks from Holly's images and posting them with the updates.</p> <p>When she looked closer, Holly found that the updates from this page posting her stolen content were getting up to 9,000 shares each.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why this was a turning point for their Facebook content strategy.</p> <p>How they changed the approach to managing the Quirky Momma Facebook page</p> <p>Holly says seeing the viral impact of their stolen images made them go back and find the top 50 posts on their blog. They concentrated on only sharing posts that were already doing well on other social media sites like Pinterest—posts that had viral potential.</p> <p>She says that they were only sharing a few times a day and sharing mostly their own stuff because that's what they knew best.

He says businesses can be successful even if they spend as little as $5 or $10 a day.</p> <p>As examples, Rick mentions using Facebook ads to guide people into a giveaway to build your email list, or to geographically target people to let locals know about a discount, offer or promotion.</p> <p>You'll hear why Rick personally likes to use Facebook ads to promote his webinars.</p> <p>As marketers, we have to be aware that people aren't on Facebook to be sold to.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover what type of freebie you should include in your offer.</p> <p>How remarketing works on Facebook</p> <p>Facebook came out this year with Website Custom Audiences, which are another form of retargeting or remarketing.</p> <p>Rick explains that you use these audiences by placing a Website Custom Audience (or remarketing) pixel on your website. The pixel tracks website visitors who are also Facebook users and builds an audience from them, so you can serve ads to them on Facebook.</p> <p>This is great. It lets you serve ads to warmer leads because they're already familiar with your business.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Rick's thoughts on using Facebook ads to grow page likes.</p> <p>About boosted posts</p> <p>If you boost a post, you're stuck with the preset levels for the ad spend and limited targeting.</p> <p>Rick says if you want more people to see a specific post, you're better off turning the post into a page post ad. To do that, you have to use the Ads Creator or Power Editor, but you'll have better control of your ad spend budget and deeper targeting options.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why Rick recommends that you don't boost posts.</p> <p>Exciting things businesses can do with Facebook ad targeting</p> <p>When most people think of targeting on Facebook, they think of interest targeting—for example, targeting people who like pages similar to your business page.</p> <p>Rick believes the really exciting stuff is Website Custom Audiences or uploading your email list to Facebook to create a custom audience that lets you target those people with your Facebook ads.</p> <p>You can take it a step further and create a lookalike audience of Facebook users from your own custom audience. These types of audiences are made up of Facebook users who share attributes similar to those in a custom audience you designate.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn how including custom elements in your ad copy leads to a higher conversion rate. </p> Have you been pondering using Facebook ads to promote your business?

They knew that they wanted to be different from every other hair salon in their area. This meant that they wanted to create an experience like no other.</p> <p>With his first book, Secret Service, he originally wanted to name it "Mastering a Norm Factor" from the TV program Cheers but he couldn't get the rights. John not only wanted their regular customers, but also the ones who only came in twice a year, to feel like the character Norm.</p> <p>The book is based around systems that they use behind the scenes to obtain customer intelligence to be able to personalize the experience.</p> <p>Although 20 years later John is no longer in the business, he still owns it. He's just finished his third book; his business, the DiJulius Group, has grown; and he now gets to travel the world to share what "secret service" really is.</p> <p>You'll hear one of the great examples that they used in the hair salons that the customers weren't aware of, but the staff knew what it meant for the customer.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear other examples of how you can differentiate your first-time customers from returning customers, and give each one a different experience.</p> <p>Why the first customer experience is so important</p> <p>John states that people aren't actual customers until they've tried you out. That's why their first experience with you is so important. It can even take 3 or 4 experiences before they become a customer.</p> <p>You have to give them an opportunity to give you a second chance. It's essential that you make them feel comfortable and create an emotional connection with them.</p> <p>John says that there are certain non-negotiables that need to happen. When you're face-to-face with the customer, you need to provide the 5 Es (the first 3 only take 1 second each simultaneously to do).</p> <p> Eye contact<br /> Enthusiastic greeting<br /> Ear-to-ear smile<br /> Engage them<br /> Educate them</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it's so important to deliver one secret service at every encounter.</p> <p>The business benefits of good customer service</p> <p>John explains that there is empirical data that looks at companies in the top 5% for customer satisfaction versus everyone else in that industry over a 7- or 10-year period. It doesn't matter what industry it is—studies show that they have higher sales growth from year to year.</p> Do you believe that you provide good customer service?

He's authored numerous books, including Twitter Marketing for Dummies and Social CRM for Dummies.</p> <p>Kyle shares why social CRM is important for marketers.</p> <p>You'll discover some of the best CRM solutions available, what their basic functions are and how social CRM can help with social media ROI.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Social CRM<br /> The difference between customer relationship management (CRM) and social CRM</p> <p>Kyle states that customer relationship management (CRM) and social CRM are combining. CRM manages all of your customers' data, and when you add the word social, it takes in all of the social data too.</p> <p>Whether you want to sell to customers or retain them, social CRM just adds those social data points. This can be a Facebook profile, Twitter account, etc.—basically anything that has to do with social media.</p> <p>It's the ability to manage all of your data points around the customer within a single software source.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Kyle doesn't distinguish between the two.</p> <p>The definition of CRM systems</p> <p>Kyle explains that a CRM system is software that allows you to manage every single touchpoint you have with your customers. For example, their email address, what they bought previously from you, their Twitter handle, and so forth. It's really based on what level of business you have.</p> <p>So if you're an enterprise company, then the CRM solution would be Salesforce. However, if you're a smaller company, Nimble would be a great alternative.</p> <p>CRM systems are anything to do with a customer interaction. This can be either in a store or online.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover why these people aren't just customers, but prospects too.</p> <p>Why social CRM is important for marketers</p> <p>Kyle refers to Mary Meeker's State of the Internet report that was released at the end of May this year. He thinks that we have reached a point where social media has hit maturity, and for us to realize the true value of it, we have to be able to connect it to our customers who are already in our systems.</p> <p>For example, if a retailer has 1000 customers within their CRM solution, they need to be able to find the social pieces of data that connect them to these existing customers. As a business, you want to turn these customers into advocates. To do this, you need to manage your data around the customer.</p> <p>Kyle believes that from a social standpoint, it allows you to recognize the true value of social and you can use it to communicate more effectively.</p> <p>You'll discover how you can drive more sales when you combine customer email addresses with their social networks.</p> <p>One of the biggest things that Kyle sees right now is marketers who use the one-click sign-on using Facebook on their website. When a customer visits your website and signs in through Facebook, you get all that customer's information. There is so much data you can pull when you connect with customers on a social...

She started to think about doing a personality assessment, which was based on the same system that she had created for brands. So instead of it being about how consumers see a brand, it's about how the world sees you.</p> <p>Once the test was ready, it was put out on social media for free and it became a huge part of her business. It surpassed Fascinate.</p> <p>Sally soon realized that people really wanted to know how to make themselves—not their brand—fascinating. She pivoted her entire company and started to study more about it and go deep into what makes one person perceived as valuable, and someone else perceived as a commodity.</p> <p>Once you have done the assessment, it becomes clear why certain people like, respect and admire you, and why you turn others off.</p> <p>The key here is that you don't have to change who you are; you have to become more of who you are.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it helps to see the patterns among your work colleagues, and how it can help you communicate more effectively with them.</p> <p>How social media has played a part in the development of this entire concept</p> <p>Before the days of social media, our average attention span used to be 20 minutes.

He blogs at ScottMonty.com and his podcast is I Hear of Sherlock Everywhere.</p> <p>Scott shares how to build relationships with bloggers to raise your visibility.</p> <p>You'll discover the types of influencers you need to reach out to and how to engage them in a positive and productive way.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Blogger Outreach<br /> Scott's definition of rented</p> <p>In a recent AdWeek interview where Scott discussed paid, earned and owned media, he referred to rented. He said, "Sites like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, we don't own those. We are using other people's property."</p> <p>Scott explains the reason for that comment was to address the concern marketers have in the drop in organic reach with their posts on Facebook.</p> <p>The challenge now is you can't ignore Facebook because there are over 1.2 billion people who use it, and you have to find a way to live with it.</p> <p>Scott says the reason why he calls these sites rented is because they are ultimately in control. If you look at Facebook, they can change the algorithm any time they like, and marketers have to suffer the consequences, unless they are willing to pay.</p> <p>You need to look at your owned sites, where you do have control. Scott thinks it's best to centralize your content in a hub, then have digital outposts of rented spaces and good relationships with influencers. Then use paid media around all of that to strategically amplify your earned, owned and rented spots.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it's not just about using paid for promoting your ads.</p> <p>Blogger outreach and why it's important </p> <p>Scott says that blogger outreach isn't that different from media relations.</p> <p>You need to look at who the influencers with an audience are, and figure out if you can either invite them to special events, give them an experience with your products or let them meet with the executives of your company. Then they can go and tell a story to their audience.</p> <p>Any brand has a story to tell and you have to think of ways you can inspire others to tell your story.</p> <p>Once you have figured out who the main industry influencers and bloggers are in your industry, then you can start to reach out to them. It's important to take note of how they interact with other brands too.</p> <p>You'll discover the parallels and distinctions between public relations and blogger relations, and how to treat each type of influencer differently.</p> <p>When Scott was at Ford, they mixed the bloggers in with journalists. Some of the true journalists weren't happy about that, and didn't give bloggers full credit for what they were able to do.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Scott and his team handled the bloggers and journalists together.</p> <p>The power of bloggers compared to traditional media</p> <p>Scott explains that most bloggers don't have the same reach or potential reach as a traditional journalist. Although there are many bloggers who have been brought under a network approach.</p> <p>For example, Do you want to attract more attention to your business?

Twitter cards give you a lot more options than you get with an ordinary tweet.</p> <p>With a normal tweet, you can upload an image that has to be rectangular. If it isn't, Twitter crops the top and bottom for it to fit. When you create a tweet with an image, the default is displayed on Twitter.com and on mobile apps.</p> <p>Tweets with images do not support Twitter cards. They are completely separate.</p> <p>Twitter cards work similarly to how Facebook pulls in default information from a post when you paste a URL into Facebook. It pulls in an image, a headline and some text.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why I believe Twitter cards only work on Twitter.com and their own mobile app right now.</p> <p>How a Twitter card works</p> <p>If you go to Twitter.com and go to a Twitter account that has Twitter cards enabled, you'll see the option to View Summary in the bottom right of the tweet.</p> <p>With Twitter's mobile app, you have to click on the tweet to see the Summary card. You'll hear the advantages and disadvantages of this one-click process.</p> <p>One of the benefits you get with a Twitter card is the amount of content you can add. You get 70 additional characters for the title, and 200 additional characters for your description.</p> <p>When you click on View Summary in a tweet, you'll notice that below the tweet is where your additional content appears. There's also the ability to include images.</p> <p>You can even include tall images. For example, I was able to display an image that was 480 x 580 pixels within a Twitter card.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what information you can include and what is powerful if you have a multi-author blog.</p> <p>Twitter card benefits for bloggers</p> <p>There are three types of Twitter cards that work well for bloggers. These are the Summary card, the Summary card with large image and the Photo card.</p> <p>1. The Summary card is the default that most bloggers will likely choose. It shows a small image that's offset to the right, and all text is below it. This is very similar to how Facebook works.</p> <p>2. The Summary card with large image is a better option if you have nice big images on your blog.</p> <p>The difference here is that the large image is above the content. When someone hits View Summary, they will see the large image before the additional information you have included.</p> <p>3. The Photo card is essentially the same as the Summary card with large image, except it doesn't have the summary. Instead you just see the photo with a headline.</p> <p>To see a Photo card in use, you can check out Mashable on Twitter. At Social Media Examiner, we use the Summary card and we use the Summary card with large image for My Kids' Adventures.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how the images you create for Facebook Open Graph on your blog can also be used for Summary cards. Have you heard of Twitter cards? Are you wondering how you can use them for your business? To learn about how Twitter cards can be beneficial to your blog, this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast goes deep on the subject. clean 47:25 Marketing Instagram Style: What Marketers Need to Know http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/marketing-instagram-style-with-jenn-herman/ Fri, 06 Jun 2014 10:00:05 +0000 http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/?p=62223 <p>Do you use Instagram for marketing?</p> <p>Are you wondering how you can grow an Instagram following that will build your business?</p> <p>To learn how Instagram can help you engage your audience, I interview Jenn Herman for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.<br /> More About This Show</p> <p>The Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>The show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).</p> <p>In this episode, I interview Jenn Herman, who blogs at Jenn's Trends and is one of our top 10 social media blog winners for 2014.

Many people believe that it's a platform for selfies and pictures of food. However, Instagram is much more than that and goes a lot deeper.</p> <p>The marketing aspect is so much stronger now, and will only continue to grow.</p> <p>So far this year, the main buzzword has been visual marketing, with Facebook and Twitter embracing visual content.</p> <p>Not only is Instagram a visual platform, it also gives you the capacity to create visual content for other sites. With the Instagram tools available, you can create fun artwork to use on your blog, website, Facebook and Twitter. It's very useful for cross-promoting.</p> <p>Right now, 65% of the world's top brands use Instagram and Jenn says the number continues to grow.</p> <p>There are 200 million monthly active users on Instagram, 70% of which log in daily. This is a huge base of people for marketers to reach. No matter who your target audience is, some of them will use the platform.</p> <p>You'll hear why you can reach people more clearly through Instagram than you can with any other platform.</p> <p>As a marketer, you should aim to create original images for Instagram. There are many different ways to incorporate your products and services into an image to make it look more native and get better engagement.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what our 2014 Social Media Marketing Industry Report revealed about visual marketing.</p> <p>Marketers who use Instagram well</p> <p>The first brand example that Jenn talks about is fashion designer Michael Kors. The way they do product placement on Instagram is amazing.</p> <p>The images they create for their fans are behind the scenes at fashion shows, photo shoots and great shots of their products. These types of images can help you to connect with your audience.</p> <p>Although Jenn loves the images, she says it's their lack of engagement that lets them down. Instagram is a highly engaged and active environment.</p> <p>Jenn advises marketers to be aware of this, and make sure that you're responsive to your followers.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear the type of images we used to create some buzz prior to Social Media Marketing World this year.</p> <p>Engagement on Instagram</p> <p>Jenn states that engagement is considerably higher on Instagram than it is on Facebook, Twitter and Google+. When Jenn tests her blog posts on all of the different platforms, Instagram almost always comes out ahead.</p> <p>One way to create engagement on Instagram is to ask a quest...

The very first interviews he ever did were for the EntrepreneurOnFire podcast.</p> <p>He says that if you listen to his first 50 episodes, it's obvious that he was new to it.</p> <p>Before John started his own podcast, he loved listening to the likes of Andrew Warner of Mixergy, Pat Flynn of Smart Passive Income and David Siteman Garland of Rise To The Top. He noticed that nobody was doing a 7-day-a-week show, and decided to give it a go.</p> <p>Although he knew he wouldn't be great in the beginning, he knew he had to start somewhere. So he reached out to people in the space to see if they would talk to him.</p> <p>You'll hear why John batch-processes his interviews for the week ahead, and how many episodes he did before he felt like he had settled in. John is now around the 608th episode mark.</p> <p>When you host a podcast, you need to come across as authentic.

To be able to do this, he knew he had to grow an audience. He had to become a leader in a particular area, industry and niche.</p> <p>When John listened to podcasts, he connected with them straightaway. He felt like he was having close relationships with the hosts and their guests—people he had never met. He says it's like being the third person in a conversation when you listen to these shows.</p> <p>For John to be able to do a show, he knew he had to be a little bit different and come up with a unique selling proposition. This is when he had his "Ah-ha" moment for a 7-day-a-week podcast. He realized that if he could interview the likes of Amy Porterfield and Adam Baker, and get them to share their journey on his platform, then he could potentially build his audience.</p> <p>You'll hear what John did to help him overcome his fear of rejection so he could build his platform from day one.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear the story behind how John and I first connected.</p> <p>How interviewing the pros has helped John's business</p> <p>John's goal from the very beginning has been to interview people who not only talk about what they are suc...

Not only was he exposed to it as a profession, but John's dad was also a great mentor to him.</p> <p>His dad always obsessed about trying to deliver value to his customers and to make sure he kept his word.</p> <p>The way people sell today has changed because of all of the different tools that are available. Back then, people knew what they wanted to buy, but now it's something different.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what John's first job was when he left college.</p> <p>How teaching and selling connect</p> <p>First of all, you don't want to be pushy with your product. Most people are turned off by this and build a wall straight away, even if they're interested.</p> <p>Instead, you need to tell stories, share examples of other people's success and start to paint a picture of how you can solve the customer's problem. John feels that with this approach, the trust barrier is removed. It's a great way for other people to relate to you as someone who delivers value, without the exchange of money.</p> <p>Some of the best ways to attract people to you is to teach through workshops, seminars or articles. A lot of people want to be taught and led by someone else. When you develop a reputation for being someone who can teach people, then you get invited to places where you have the opportunity to sell.</p> <p>A lot of people still believe that if you give too much away, you won't be hired. However, from John's experience (and mine), it's the total opposite. The more you give and demonstrate your expertise for free, the more likely you are to attract that ideal customer. People see you as someone who is willing to give before they ask.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover the percentage of business that John receives from people who are not customers or he doesn't have direct interaction with.</p> <p>An example of a business that is winning by teaching</p> <p>One of the first companies that comes to mind is HubSpot, which makes a profit from teaching. They produce great ebooks and run live webinars with different experts.</p> <p>Another company that John personally uses is REI, which sells quality outdoor gear. They do a tremendous amount of teaching on their website. The information they provide supports the products they sell. It's great for the outdoor enthusiast who wants to be part of that community, as well as buy a product from them.</p> <p>You'll hear a great example of how a small software company stood out from their competitors in the way they market their product and why John believes it's the key to success.</p> Are you looking for a way to grow your influence while making more sales?

When she returned to collect the check, the customer had crossed out the 18% and had written, "I give God 10%, why do you get 18%?" The customer left a 10% tip instead.</p> <p>One of the waitress' friends took a photo of the receipt, which included the customer's name, and posted it on Reddit. This led to it going viral and the whole world saw it.</p> <p>Applebee's response was that they were going to fire the waitress and her friend, because it was against their policy to show pictures or talk about customers. Especially when a name is included.</p> <p>What happened next on Applebee's Facebook page added fuel to the fire.</p> <p>Applebee's replied to every person's comment on Facebook with a canned PR response. You'll hear what the response included.</p> <p>People didn't take kindly to the way Applebee's handled the situation, and started to dig deep on the Internet. Pictures were discovered that had been posted with good customer feedback on their Facebook page. Although these pictures included the customer's name, nobody got fired for it. A Facebook page was then started to try to get the waitress' job back.</p> <p>You'll hear what Gini's gut instinct was on the person who was handling the corporate Facebook page for Applebee's, and why it contributed to the crisis.</p> <p>Gini advises you never to use a canned PR message on social media, because it's about being social. You need to engage, be transparent and remain human. This means you need to show sympathy and empathy toward what's happening.</p> <p>Always take time to think about the statement before you put it out there.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how the way you handle a social media crisis can affect your sales.</p> <p>The first thing you should do once you're aware of an issue</p> <p>Gini says that the first thing you should do is understand what has happened. This means communicating with both sides to get the bigger picture.</p> <p>In Applebee's case, they should have listened to the customer, the waitress and her friend before they did anything else—whether they had a policy in place or not.</p> <p>You have to remember that we live in a world of instant gratification, where people tend to react before they think the situation through. This is when trouble starts and the problem spirals out of control.</p> <p>As a company, you need to step back and figure out your plan of action and you...

He didn't really care for comments—for him it was more about generating daily content.</p> <p>More recently, Brian Clark and his team at Copyblogger decided to shut down their blog comments. As a result of this, there has been a lot of interesting dialogue in this space.</p> <p>The upside of blog comments</p> <p>Mark explains how there are a lot of different business reasons behind blogs, and it's up to each individual business to make the decision whether to have comments on their blog.</p> <p>He says that there are probably some very good economic reasons why Copyblogger decided to remove comments, but Mark thinks that blog comments are the economic engine.</p> <p>The community that Mark has built on his blog has led to many different business benefits for him and his community. You can get to know people in the comment area, which can lead to collaborations, customers and suppliers.</p> <p>Mark feels that a lot of influence takes place in the blog communities, where you can develop strong relationships compared to the ones you make on Twitter or Facebook.</p> <p>You'll hear other great benefits that come from comments on your blog, and why Mark sees them as a gift every day.</p> <p>The Huffington Post has a little bit of a different viewpoint, just because of their sheer size. They face a bigger challenge because of the number of comments they get every day. It's hard for them to actually interact and engage with every single commenter.</p> <p>Tim explains at this point, it's a matter of them looking at some of the prolific commenters on their site and working with them. They've found that some commenters don't want to write for them, they are happy just commenting.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out the cost of engagement, and why you can engage yourself broke.</p> <p>Some of the challenges the Huffington Post faces with blog comments</p> <p>Tim says that the biggest issue for them is to figure out how to allow people to share and express their thoughts on content, while appreciating that the standard for commenting is different from their editorial standards.</p> <p>They have to find ways to moderate this effectively with the different languages, countries and time zones.</p> <p>You can't replace a human when it comes comment moderation.

If you haven't dealt with haters yet, the chance of dealing with one in the future is pretty good.</p> <p>I'm going to share a story with you that happened recently to us, and my hope is that it will prepare you for these types of people. If you let them have their way, then they succeed and you fail. This will impede your progress.</p> <p>The story is about an entertainment piece that was made for Social Media Marketing World 2014. Phil Mershon, who is my event director, created an original jingle called "Let's Get Social," which was sung by Mary McCoy from Continuum Marketing Services.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itvvFfeLh84</p> <p>The song was performed just before Jay Baer took the stage with a panel, which included Ted Rubin, Nichole Kelly and Jeffrey Rohrs. The panel discussion was entitled "Have We Lost The Social in Social Media?"</p> <p>This particular piece of entertainment was designed to be funny, and was to set the stage for the panel discussion. Even though it was corny, attendees got into it. Although on the video, you can't grasp the audience's reaction.</p> <p>The video was originally released on the event page for Social Media Examiner, on my personal Facebook profile and on Social Media Examiner's Facebook page. It was never intended to be released to the public.</p> <p>The day after it was uploaded, it started to go crazy viral. The first day alone it received 75,000 views on YouTube. The number of negative and nasty comments on YouTube was unbelievable.</p> <p>Phil and I had a discussion as to whether to close off the comments, but I didn't feel that was appropriate. You'll hear the reasons why I kept the comments open, and what I hoped would happen.</p> <p>An article was then published by Gawker called The Devil Is Real, and He Made a Song About Social Media Marketing. Gawker is a gossip blog that has a section called Valley Wag, which covers the social space.</p> <p>This very negative post spurred a lot of the video's views and negative comments on YouTube. Following this blog post, Mashable, Huffington Post, Slate and CNET also covered the story.</p> <p>By the Friday of that week, VH1 created this 90-second comedy piece of the video:</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv6byr_JKuk</p> <p>To date, our video has been viewed nearly 500,000 times, with just over a 1,000 comments. At one point it ranked #15 worldwide. Someone has even made an acoustic version of it, Have you ever been publicly criticized or mocked for something that you did?

The formula he uses is traffic × your conversion rate = success, which can be leads, subscribers or ecommerce customers.</p> <p>The more you're aware of how things are connected and the deeper you look down the funnel, the more equipped you'll be to make better decisions. It's just like the dashboard of a car.</p> <p>You'll hear what happened when I looked a lot deeper into the analytics of a Social Media Examiner article that ranks number one in Google search, and why it made me realize that it wasn't doing as well as I thought.</p> <p>As a marketer, you need to reprogram your mind to what really matters, and it's not what immediately meets the eye.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it's so important to pay attention to the conversion rate.</p> <p>Do you need to be a data nerd to benefit from all of this?</p> <p>Andy says that you don't have to be a data nerd. The only math you need to know is that anything times zero equals zero.</p> <p>Andy relates it to a Magic 8 Ball. You can ask a question, shake up the analytics and find the answer. As a marketer, you need to know how to look at these numbers. It gets easier over time. For every action you take, you can measure it and see if it works, and then make improvements.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Google Analytics is similar to using Photoshop.</p> <p>Common mistakes marketers make with Google Analytics</p> <p>According to Andy, it always comes down to the setup of Google Analytics. There are two or three basic steps you need to take in the Admin section of Google Analytics that make your data much more meaningful.</p> <p>One of the first things you need to do is filter out the traffic from your own IP address. Until you do this, your analytics will be polluted by your own activity. Within the Admin section, you can create an IP address filter.</p> <p>To find out what your IP address is, just type "What is my IP?" into Google search, and it will give you the number. You'll discover what to do with this number in the dashboard to ensure your results are more meaningful.</p> <p>The next step (which is important) is goals. Until you set up your goals, you'll only have half of the picture.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what's important if you are a relatively low-traffic site or you're into content or social media marketing.</p> <p>The definitions of goals and conversions</p> Do you want to know if your content and social activities are supporting your business?

These individuals were chosen by LinkedIn to be a part of the initial rollout.</p> <p>More recently LinkedIn has opened up the publishing platform to all 277 million+ members. It will be rolled out over time, allowing every single person the opportunity to publish his or her own content on the LinkedIn platform.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why this new addition is great for publishing long-form content.</p> <p>Does the LinkedIn platform support images and multimedia?</p> <p>Stephanie says that you can embed content from SlideShare, which is owned by LinkedIn.

In addition, you can embed images in the posts that you publish to LinkedIn.</p> <p>The formatting capabilities are very similar to a basic blogging platform. It's a little bit easier to use than WordPress, although you don't have the ability within the editor to categorize or tag your posts. You can use headers, bullets, numbered lists, bold, italics and hyperlink text as well.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it's really important to double-check your post before you hit Publish.</p> <p>Marketers and business owners should consider posting content on LinkedIn</p> <p>You have to remember that LinkedIn is your professional identity online and this not only gives you an opportunity to demonstrate and illustrate your expertise, but also to get in front of a very active and engaged audience.</p> <p>You'll discover why you now have the ability to grow a following on LinkedIn—even with people who aren't in your LinkedIn network—and how this can be a huge benefit to your business. It's still important to have your own platform that's away from all of the other social networks.</p> <p>One of the real advantages of when you use the LinkedIn publishing platform is that you can grow an audience very fast.

She likes to explore what's new and the new places people go online to talk and build communities.</p> <p>So when the first private beta invites for Google+ started to go out, Lynette spent 4 hours on the platform. She fell in love with it straight away and has stuck with it ever since.</p> <p>Lynette says that when she started on Google+, she had a little more confidence than with other platforms because it's Google. She soon figured out the set of tools available and what they could offer for her as a person and as a marketer.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Lynette feels that Google+ is very anti-Apple.</p> <p>The business benefits of using Google+</p> <p>Lynette looks at Google+ as the Internet and part of Google. Right now they have about 60 products and Google+ is just one piece of it all. It's a way for Google to link all their products together.</p> <p>When you are in the Google ecosystem, it's where you live for search, email, videos, etc. Lynette sees Google+ as a platform that touches everything she does on the Internet.</p> <p>Since the platform launched, it's grown up in many ways and like it or not, Google owns quite a large chunk of the Internet. As marketers, we use a large number of their products in our everyday lives.</p> <p>When you're signed into Google+, you receive alerts when you get new activity. This appears in the right-hand corner of your screen as a bell icon.</p> <p>Lynette explains how it's not so much about the numbers you get, but what you do with them. So whenever you go to a Google property, you'll see these alerts. You'll hear why people are drawn into these numbers, even if they aren't on Google+.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Google attracts you into their ecosystem and tracks your activity.</p> <p>What Facebook marketers need to know about Google+ users</p> <p>Google+ is more of an interest-based network, whereas Facebook is the place where people connect with others they already know.</p> <p>Lynette says that Google+ is more like Twitter or Reddit. Not in the form of how you can publish, but how the communities separate themselves and group together. As a marketer, this is what you want.</p> <p>If you want to get your message out, you obviously want to gravitate toward people you know will meet your criteria and will hopefully want your product.</p> <p>Lynette finds it a lot easier to reach these communities on Google+ than she does on ...

An example is Jake Thompson who has an apparel brand called Compete Everyday, which is a similar premise to Life Is Good.</p> <p>You'll hear Chris' definition of the word freak, and why they choose their own adventure.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear Chris' story about the original Choose Your Own Adventure books.</p> <p>Why some freaks are successful in business and others are not</p> <p>Chris explains why Richard Branson is successful for being a freak.</p> <p>One of his very first businesses was a company that sold records in the UK. When he told people he would distribute records overseas, he discovered that he could get them for a lot less money. So he went on to resell them in the UK and undercut all of the other retailers.</p> <p>He has since gone on to own 400 successful companies, lives on an island of his own creation and has been knighted.</p> <p>You'll discover why Richard Branson is Chris' biggest business idol.</p> <p>A true freak is someone who stays true to what they are passionate about, even if they don't fit within the box. Then you have people who are weird for weird's sake. This is the type of person who looks for attention, but it's not really who they are.</p> <p>Chris gives an example of violinist Lindsey Stirling, who is doing extremely well. She has 2.3 million likes on Facebook and has a huge group that follows and connects with her. Although what she does has no part in modern pop culture, she has stuck with her love of the violin and brought her own energy to it. It's a way for her to put her own story out there.</p> <p>The freaks who are successful actually stay pretty close to who they are. They have something to offer and help others at the same time.</p> <p>One way to find out if you're a freak is to consider the quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Do not go where the road may lead, but go where there is no road and leave a trail." You'll find that people react differently to it. Do you feel like you don’t fit in? Are you wondering how you can succeed in business by being different?

It also enables him to expand reach ridiculously in a short period of time.</p> <p>Chris says that he enjoys podcasting because he is more of a talker than a typer. The last thing he wanted to do after he had written his book was to write blog posts to promote it.</p> <p>So when they put together a marketing plan for the book, there was no doubt in Chris' mind that a special podcast with the same name would be the best approach.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out the two main reasons why Chris chose podcasting to help with the launch of his new book.</p> <p>Why add a podcast to the launch plan for a new product?</p> <p>Brian tells the story of how during his time as an attorney, he was first introduced to the word rainmaker, which means the person who brings in the business.</p> <p>It was back in 1998 that Brian started to publish online and he became an entrepreneur. He didn't have professional or family privileges, so he couldn't be the traditional type of rainmaker that he had observed earlier. Reflecting on it, he saw that the Internet was his way to become a rainmaker. Nearly sixteen years later, it's played out really well. It's the genesis of the concept itself.</p> <p>Copyblogger has done a couple of podcasts, and although they don't have the hugest uptake, people do love them.</p> <p>Brian says that they see audio as a completely new channel to reach people who may not be familiar with their brand, and this is in line with the product they'll soon launch.</p> <p>You'll hear why Brian sees audio as the best foundational content, from which you can create every other form of content.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why the New Rainmaker podcast is more than just a podcast.</p> <p>Where is the world of podcasting heading?</p> <p>Brian believes that the reason podcasts didn't do as well as expected back in 2005 was because it was hard for people to make money with sponsorships or advertising.</p> <p>However, everyone uses content to sell things, and the world seems to be waking up to this. Consequently there has been a big resurgence in podcasting.</p> <p>The way Apple has embraced podcasts as a format within iTunes has made it easy to subscribe and more people than ever are now aware of them.</p> <p>You'll hear why podcasts work for anybody who knows what they're talking about, and why Brian believes we are entering the golden age of...

Brands used to be able to push out one-way communication to their audience, and it was seen as acceptable. However, since social came about, human-to-human interaction has changed.</p> <p>Marketers now struggle to connect with people via social media because of fear. With the mass adoption of social media, it has enabled global and public conversations. Brands are now under a magnifying glass and are struggling to find their voice.</p> <p>Bryan expresses that there's still a lot of fear in the business community because of social. In his new book, Human to Human, he has divided the fears into three distinct categories. You'll hear an example for each category.</p> <p> Fear of not being on social media.<br /> Fear of saying the wrong thing.<br /> Fear of what engaging means for your company.</p> <p>Lady Gaga is a great example of someone who engages with fans in a more intimate setting, which is away from Facebook and Twitter. It's within this network that fans help her create content.</p> <p>This idea is perfect for brands that are afraid to dialogue with millions of people. They can instead measure it down to a group of people with whom they want to actually engage.</p> <p>For businesses to overcome their fears, they need to educate their audience and their employees. You need to help these people understand how to conduct a dialogue and how to be human online. Bryan explains that part of it is to understand the different senses, in the way you can interact with people and then teach it to them.</p> <p>With the sensory marketing that is available right now, there is something for everyone.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it's important to start with one sense at a time.</p> <p>Explain what you mean by "In social, content is important, but context is HUGE."</p> <p>Bryan says that with the convergence of social, mobile and digital technology, it has changed the way we communicate with each other. It's become a floodgate of communication without context. This is where the problem lies.</p> <p>Over 90% of human communication is conveyed through video language queues. This means that if 90% of what you talk about in person has to be visual communication, then it leaves only 10% non-visual communication online.</p> <p>You'll hear what Matt Clark at Tweet Pages creates for prospects, and why it's a great example of human-to-human communication.</p> <p>This has led Matt to become a speaker for Social Media Marketing World 2014.

He wanted to wait for a publisher to come to him.</p> <p>Once he had built his blog, someone from Wiley contacted him to ask why he hadn't written a book. This led Scott to write his first book, UnMarketing.</p> <p>The book was aimed at entrepreneurs. People who were able and willing to shift their minds to do things a different way. You'll hear why Scott was surprised when it caught on with corporations.</p> <p>In 2009, when social took off to another level, Scott realized that he would have to become more focused. So he started with Twitter. He'd already tried Twitter in 2008 and didn't think much of it, but in January 2009 he decided to try it for 30 days. During this period, he tweeted 7000 times.</p> <p>At the start of the month, he had 1200 followers and by the end of the month, he had 10,000. This made him realize that not only was there potential on Twitter, but there was great potential for conversation. He's never stopped tweeting since. To date he has over 100,000 tweets and 165,000 followers.</p> <p>Scott says that one of the biggest mistakes people make with Twitter is that they create a lot of content first and then go onto Twitter with no followers and expect to pitch it. Instead you should give to the network, rather than go out there and sell. When Scott started out on Twitter, he didn't have a blog, so he had no content to share on Twitter.</p> <p>You'll hear how back in 2009, Twitter was more about people talking to people. The term social strategy wasn't even around. Scott believes that if he used the same strategy now for a month, his results would be a lot different than they were back then. The platform has definitely migrated and shifted.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Mitch Joel calls Scott a storyteller.</p> <p>The story behind the Instant No Button</p> <p>The Instant No Button is a 7-minute project that Scott threw together about 4 years ago. He loved the Instant Fail button sound and decided to do a "No" version.</p> <p>To date it has been clicked 20 million times. Scott says the funny thing about it is that most people have seen it, but are totally unaware that it's his. This type of project goes to show that people share great content, even if it's funny or stupid.</p> <p>The free No Button app has recently been launched in the Google Play Store and has already gotten 30,000 downloads.

Her newest book is called The Power of Visual Storytelling.</p> <p>Ekaterina shares why storytelling is important for your business.</p> <p>You'll discover how to get started, the type of visuals that work and brands that do it well.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher, SoundCloud or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Visual Storytelling<br /> How did you fall into visual storytelling?</p> <p>Ekaterina explains how her job at Intel for the last 5 years was building social business, and it was during her final 3 years there that she started to notice the perfect shift to visual storytelling. So for her, visual storytelling was a natural progression.</p> <p>Several years ago, she started to look at the data and usage of visuals versus the usage of just text and links. This led to her first blog post on Fast Company, called The Rise of Visual Social Media.</p> <p>You'll hear why this particular article led Ekaterina to write more on this subject.</p> <p>Ekaterina believes that the reason why visuals are so well-received is that we are moving into a world that is inundated with information. There are filters that allow us to stand out from the noise. One of them, in Ekaterina's view, is visual marketing and visual storytelling.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what term Ekaterina uses for the world we are moving into.</p> <p>What is visual storytelling and why should marketers consider it for their business?</p> <p>The way that visual storytelling is defined in Ekaterina's new book, The Power of Visual Storytelling, is the use of images, video, infographics and potentially presentations and other visuals in social media.</p> <p>The use of visuals on social media platforms can help you craft a graphic story around your brand's key values and offerings. It helps show who you are as a brand and makes consumers want to connect with you.</p> <p>With the rise of millennials (digital natives and the younger generation), it's essential that they not only know what you offer or how useful a product is, but also how they can be part of the movement and fit within that tribe. It's what visual storytelling allows you to do. It's how you reach that emotional connection with your customers.</p> <p>Recently, Jason Miller of LinkedIn created a widely shared infographic titled, A Well-Balanced Blog.</p> <p>The reason why this type of content works is that it's simple thinking. Our brains process visuals 60,000 times faster than text. About 93% of all communication is nonverbal.</p> <p>You'll hear an example of how you can gather a story from an image, rather than a word on its own. The emotional connection is critical.</p> <p>Studies show that blog posts with visuals drive up to 180% more engagement than those without. This means that a visual image can allow people to digest your content, then decide if they want to continue to read the article.</p> <p>The amount of information that is produced every 48 hours is the same amount that was produced from the beginning of time up until 2003. Every year, our attention span becomes shorter. Now it's about 3-8 seconds. Do you use visuals to market your business? Are you wondering how you can tell a story with visuals? To learn how your business can benefit from visual storytelling, I interview Ekaterina Walter for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast. clean 41:28 Twitter Chats: How to Create a Successful Tweet Chat http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/twitter-chats-with-pam-moore/ Fri, 28 Feb 2014 11:00:58 +0000 http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/?p=54309 <p>Are you familiar with Twitter chats?</p> <p>Wondering how Twitter chats can help market your business?</p> <p>To learn more about Twitter chats and what they can mean for your business, I interview Pam Moore for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.<br /> More About This Show</p> <p>The Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>The show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).</p> <p>In this episode, I interview Pam Moore, founder of Marketing Nutz, an agency specializing in social media marketing.

Their purpose is to organize conversation and connect people.</p> <p>Pam says that if you're new to social media, and to Twitter specifically, then Twitter chats are a great way for you to learn how to use it. Twitter chats not only allow you to form a deep connection with a community, but Pam has also seen people empower their lives and businesses faster than they thought possible.</p> <p>When you plan a tweet chat, you can make them formal or informal. You'll find out why Pam recommends that you have a combination of both. You can also do tweet chats in a series, which can help with your brand's positioning. With this type of tweet chat, you need to put together a strategy over several months.</p> <p>One of Pam's clients, IBM, recently held an event called IBM Connect in Orlando, where they hosted tweet chats with some of the influencers and speakers for the event. The aim of these tweet chats was to generate awareness and excitement for the event, plus drive registration.</p> <p>This particular chat had over 40 million impressions over the course of a few days, and included 2500 tweets. Nearly 600 people took part in the conversation.</p> <p>You'll find out what comes after the tweet chat that is just as important as the chat itself and why you are left with a social asset.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what IBM added to the front and back ends of their tweet chat for IBM Connect.</p> <p>Why host a tweet chat?</p> <p>One of the marketing benefits when you host your own tweet chat is that you can start to a build a community around it. You can capture the mindshare of that audience for a specific time on a regular basis. This gives you an opportunity to communicate and support your marketing objectives.</p> <p>Your core goal is to focus on the needs of your audience. When you provide great content, which can bring good people to the community, then they'll begin to depend on you and want more.</p> <p>Pam has seen so many people—clients included—grow their businesses and make connections and partnerships. It easily puts you in a leadership role.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover how a tweet chat can easily go viral.</p> <p>How to prepare for a tweet chat</p> <p>Pam says that the process includes both art and science. As the chat leader, you need to provide some framework, but you don't want it to look like you have planned everything that you say.</p> <p>You have to balance structure with flexibility and agility. In a structured-style tweet chat, you have a list of questions. Pam usually creates a list of questions and has a specific topic to talk about.</p> Are you familiar with Twitter chats? Wondering how Twitter chats can help market your business?

You can also create an enormous amount of buzz on Twitter.</p> <p>Here are five techniques to help you promote and boost excitement around what you have to offer.<br /> #1: Include a Customized Tweet Button on Every Single Page of Your Product<br /> When you have several pages on your product, service or event site, it's important to have the same tweet on every single page.</p> <p>The first thing you need to do is create a custom Twitter share button. The button options available are Share a Link, Follow, Hashtag and Mention. You want to choose the Share a Link button.</p> <p>The next step is to click on the option to include a different URL, rather than the Use the Page URL option. In this particular case, you'll use the home page of your product, service or event. So when someone clicks on that tweet button to share on Twitter, they'll be directed back to one central place, which is your home page.</p> <p>The next option is Tweet Text. This is where you can write in your own custom tweet. Also make sure you check the Show Count option, because it will display the total number of tweets.</p> <p>You'll hear why it's important to show the number of tweets on your sales page, and the advantages to the Via and Recommend Twitter ID options.</p> <p>The last step is to add a hashtag. When you visit our event page for Social Media Marketing World, you'll notice that once you click on the tweet button, not only does it have our customized tweet, but it also includes the URL for the home page and the hashtag for the event.</p> <p>Once you have created your custom tweet, it'll give you a little piece of code that you can put in a sidebar widget if you're on WordPress, or embed the HTML where you want it. The good news is that it works over and over again.</p> <p>Here are a few tips on how to craft your tweet:</p> <p> Write the tweet as if the user was writing it him- or herself.<br /> Make sure it's not overly promotional.<br /> Craft it in a way that it's easy to read.<br /> Include a hashtag.</p> <p>Listen to the show to discover the types of phrases you should use in your custom tweet.<br /> #2: Embed a Twitter Widget on Every Page That You Use to Promote<br /> When you visit the event page for Social Media Marketing World, you'll see the widget below. On the event page it's live.</p> <p>You can see the hashtag at the top, and underneath are the tweets relating to the event. The reason that they're all in one place is because of the hashtag.</p> <p>As you scroll through the tweets, you'll see the people who have clicked on the custom tweet, plus those who are talking about the event in general.</p> <p>You'll hear why the value proposition in something like this on your sales page is huge, and the reason why I decided to have it on every single page at Social Media Examiner.</p> Do you use social media to promote your product, service or events? Are you wondering how you can use Twitter to help get more visibility and sales?

However, because he's a big fan of podcasts, he noticed that more people had started to use them, although he didn't see a corresponding change in attitude from people in the media world.</p> <p>Over the last five years, podcasting has been viewed as a less popular form of media. Even online and new media startups haven't embraced it. So Mike decided to dig in and find out why.</p> <p>Mike talked to many people including big-name hosts like Adam Carolla, Ira Glass from This American Life and Steven Dubner from Freakonomics. He also had contact with people behind the scenes at organizations such as Libsyn and Microsoft.</p> <p>During his research, Mike recorded all of the conversations he had with these people, which led to an article he wrote for Forbes in April 2013 called "Funnymen and iPhones: Why the Podcast Is Finally Coming Into its Own."</p> <p>Listen to the audio clip below to find out what Adam Carolla had to say.</p> <p>https://soundcloud.com/nextmarket/a-podcast-about-the-podcast</p> <p>Apple has primarily owned the investment side of podcasts with iTunes.

Also some of the big-name podcasters have seen traffic reach new records in download numbers every month.</p> <p>All of the signs are from a metrics perspective. When you talk to people about their numbers, there is definitely growth.</p> <p>When you look at the iTunes charts, you'll notice there are new podcasts launched every day/week across a number of categories.</p> <p>Mike says that part of the reason for the growth of this platform is that a lot of people see podcasting as a less crowded channel than blogging. It's also a form of deeper engagement.</p> <p>You'll discover what has created the perfect storm for this new growth in listenership, and why new technology built into cars will produce a whole new opportunity.</p> Have you considered podcasting for your business?

In the book, he discusses his ideas about writing and how to write well. Although it's a great book, Danny didn't get the response he was looking for.</p> <p>The lesson he learned is that when you write copy, it's not actually about the words. You need to understand the people you want to connect with, and understand what matters to them.</p> <p>Danny's copywriting practice evolved over time into a marketing and strategy consultancy.</p> <p>You'll hear what happened when he attended local networking sessions that made him want to create a training program.</p> <p>Danny soon discovered that people who didn't have an audience wanted to know more about engagement; and therefore, he wanted to help them. He started to reach out to all of the experts who had built an engaged audience from nothing.</p> <p>With their input and perspectives, his new book, Engagement from Scratch! was created.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it's important to be sensitive to other people's needs.</p> <p>Definition of engagement</p> <p>Since his latest book was published, Danny says that he has developed the insight that engagement is about the deep emotional investment that people have in what you are doing.</p> <p>If you think about Apple's customers, they are members of the Apple tribe. The fact that they use Apple's products actually says something about who that person is. It's a piece of their identity.</p> <p>Not only are these customers incredibly engaged, they are also invested in what Apple does. If the company were to betray the values they stand for, the response would be dramatic. They would feel like a friend had betrayed them.</p> <p>Danny says that the best model for conceptualizing engagement is by increasing the feeling of commitment through rewards over time. When someone discovers you for the first time, there is no connection, relationship or engagement. You have to give them something to keep them coming back.</p> <p>Make sure you give people an opportunity to provide you with their name and email address. Once they commit, you can reward them.</p> <p>You'll find out another great way to get people to invest some of their time and attention, which will help you build a relationship with them. It's important to stand out from the competition, and one way to do this is to answer emails personally. This puts you in a whole different category.</p> <p>To be a good email marketer, Is audience loyalty important to your business?

Images process quickly and people are drawn to them.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why visual marketing has merged with social media.</p> <p>Why do visuals matter so much?</p> <p>Donna explains how most people started out with a blog, where they would write in long form and build a community around it. Then along came Facebook, where posts became shorter and then Twitter burst onto the scene with a 140-character limit.</p> <p>People have moved from blogs to microblogs and now to multimedia microblogs. The only direction to go is to communicate with pictures. With Instagram and Pinterest, you can communicate purely with images. Sometimes words aren't even necessary.</p> <p>Images have become even more popular with the ability to take photos and video with the camera on a smartphone.</p> <p>Detavio Samuels, who owns the marketing business Global Hue, said, "The only thing shorter than a tweet or a post is a picture."</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why all platforms are becoming image-centric.</p> <p>Image options for marketers</p> <p>Donna explains how you can use images in different ways in your marketing.</p> <p>You can make a short, snappy video; use images and graphics; slides or a SlideShare presentation; infographics and text-based images.</p> <p>You'll find out which one from the list below Donna discovered gets the most shares and responses.</p> <p> Tips<br /> How-to<br /> Quotes<br /> Checklists<br /> Infographics</p> <p>Jay Baer talks about being inherently useful in his book Youtility. If you want your image to be shared a lot, then you have to make sure it's helpful to your target audience.</p> <p>You have to remember that as humans, we connect emotionally to images more than video, audio or text. People make decisions and take action quicker when prompted by images, rather than by reading a lot of text.</p> <p>You'll find out how you can use how-to images for your business and why it's easier than you think.</p> <p>Another great option is to tease people with a graphic. You don't have to provide the whole procedure; instead add a call to action to get people to click through to your blog, Facebook page or Pinterest page.</p> <p>On Facebook, you want to build engagement, so the image should be one that people will share, rather than click through to your blog. If you are clever, you can get some really great results.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn why people feel compelled to click...

They don't seem to attend any sessions other than their own. It's an opportunity to have amazing conversations with influential people.</p> <p>You'll hear the types of questions I asked to get people engaged, which can develop into real relationships. This is one of the secrets to the success of my business, and it can be for you too.</p> <p>My take-home lesson is to get involved in real life through face-to-face encounters. One of the best places to do this is at a conference. Our upcoming conference, Social Media Marketing World, is a great place to start.</p> <p>Are relationships still important AND achievable with social media?</p> <p>Ted Rubin likes to say that "relationships are the new currency." With all of the different social media channels available, you can reach the world 24/7, without ever leaving your home. It used to be that you had to wait until you were at a company meeting or an event to meet people.</p> <p>The problem today is that when people click your name or check a box to follow you, they immediately think they have a real relationship with you or your brand.</p> <p>A lot of brands believe that they need to get as many likes and followers as possible so they can broadcast to them. It's not about broadcasting, though—it's about building relationships. Do you want to develop relationships that will lead to business?

Mari is the co-author of Facebook Marketing: An Hour a Day and considered to be the world's leading expert on Facebook marketing and Jay is the author of Youtility: Why Smart Marketing Is About Help Not Hype. He's also host of the Social Pros podcast.</p> <p>Mari and Jay share how to be successful with Facebook's new algorithm and what these changes mean for your Facebook strategy.</p> <p>You'll learn how to monitor your reach and engagement, and how to navigate paid versus earned media in your content strategy.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Facebook Marketing Declines<br /> Recently, an article by AdAge referenced an official Facebook document that said, "We expect organic distribution of an individual page's posts to gradually decline over time, as we continually work to make sure people have a meaningful experience on the site."</p> <p>In other words, Facebook says that they are going to show less of your Facebook updates to your fans and followers. If you want to get seen, you will have to pay to play.</p> <p>This news has raised a lot of concern among marketers.</p> <p>Previous changes to the Facebook news feed</p> <p>Mari explains how up until a few months ago, the algorithm that governs what content goes into the news feed was called EdgeRank. The term used now is the Facebook news feed ranking algorithm.</p> <p>The formula changed dramatically, with Facebook telling everyone that on any given day, a user can potentially see 1,500 possible stories. A story includes likes, comments, shares, videos and photos.</p> <p>Once you click Like, Comment or Share, Facebook knows what type of content to show you. Most users are aware that the majority of content shown comes from friends.</p> <p>This means that business pages struggle to get organic visibility.</p> <p>On December 2, 2013, Facebook announced they will start to decline or diminish organic reach for pages because users predominantly want to see content from friends and brands that they enjoy interacting with. According to Inside Facebook, studies show more than 40% decreased organic reach on Facebook.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what type of content Facebook will give less weight to.</p> <p>Is Facebook trying to protect its fans from marketers? </p> <p>I recently heard Gary Vaynerchuk say that Facebook is trying to protect its fans from marketers. It seems that Facebook has realized that they need to provide a quality user experience, otherwise people won't click on the ads.</p> <p>Jay explains why Facebook doesn't want to devolve into MySpace. They are now a public company, which needs to continue to generate tons of advertising money. One of the ways to do this is to squeeze the algorithm.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how Facebook has used one of the oldest business playbooks in history to get you hooked.</p> <p>Marketers see a decline in organic reach</p> <p>In December, an article by Ignite Social Media showed that brands saw massive declines in organic reach that month.</p> <p>Jay says that a large number of brands on Facebook have seen a decline in organic reach...

Facebook only allows users to select three images.</p> <p>To see how this works, check out my friend Jon Loomer's guide on Facebook Link Thumbnail Image Dimensions.</p> <p>The aspect ratio of your image is the critical factor. The aspect ratio is 1.91:1. This calculates out to about 1200 pixels wide by 627 pixels deep. The ideal size is 400 pixels wide by 209 pixels deep.</p> <p>You need to make sure that at least one of your images inside the article is larger than all of the others. It should be in the 1.91:1 aspect ratio.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what happens when an image is deeper than it is wide and how it can appear in the Facebook news feed.<br /> #2: Implement Facebook Open Graph Tags<br /> Facebook has its own language called Open Graph. This allows you to tell Facebook certain kinds of attributes, which include the image it should use as a default on a page, where it should pull text from and what the description should be. This kind of information helps your content appear more appropriately in the news feed.</p> <p>You can discover all of the data behind Open Graph and find everything you need to know about how it works. It's a great guide even for the non-techie.</p> <p>If you are on WordPress, Open Graph is easy to implement with a plugin called WP Open Graph. It allows you to set data on a macro-level and on a post-by-post basis. It's a great way to control what shows up when people share your articles on Facebook.</p> <p>The best way to keep your shared content up to date on Facebook is to use Facebook's Debugger. It's a great tool to stop Facebook from pulling in information that's no longer relevant.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how the Debugger tool works, and how it will help you with your Open Graph.<br /> #3: Add a Facebook Share Button to Your Website<br /> When you add a Facebook Share button to your website, you need to make sure that you use the code from Facebook or the WordPress plugin, which was developed by Facebook.</p> <p>It doesn't matter if your website is WordPress or not, you can visit here and paste in the URL you want to share and choose the different layouts for your button.</p> <p>You'll discover the best Share button to use for social proof on your website.</p> <p>If you use WordPress, it's easy to use their default plugin. This plugin allows you to do the same as the Facebook one, but it does everything automatically for you.</p> Is your website using Facebook to the fullest?

He gets as many podcast downloads a month for This Is Your Life as he gets unique visitors to his blog. His audience has doubled because of it.</p> <p>He believes that you get a different kind of follower with your podcast. Many people have said that they have never read his blog; instead they've connected with him through his podcast.</p> <p>You'll discover why podcasting is more intimate and why this type of connection has benefited Michael's business.</p> <p>Chris shares his story of how he got into podcasting in 2005, when it was still the early days for this type of platform. He started an event called Podcamp with Christopher Penn.</p> <p>Back then it wasn't easy for people to consume a podcast, so it wasn't a great time for the independent podcaster.</p> <p>A year or so ago, Chris decided to jump back in again and started The Human Business Way. You'll find out why Chris puts in a lot of effort to make sure his show is a very personal experience.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why a podcast is a great platform to build a community around.</p> <p>Podcast frequency</p> <p>Chris has tried all different schedules for his podcast. He originally put his show out weekly, then more frequently than that and has also gone weeks between shows.</p> <p>He originally told everybody that he would close the show at 100 episodes. This wasn't to hurt his relationship with his community, but to carry out tests as a marketer on the flexibility, expansion and depth of his show.</p> <p>You'll hear how these results helped him with the new show format.</p> <p>Michael's podcast is a weekly show. He tries to deliver it on a Wednesday morning because people count on it.</p> <p>You'll hear the type of content schedule Michael has and what he did last summer when he had a month off to write his book that resulted in only a 10% traffic hit.</p> <p>The take-home lesson is to figure out what your audience expects. You'll hear Chris share the formula that works for his audience and how he gets around people's unwillingness to commit.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out one of the downsides to having too many podcasts in a short period of time.</p> <p>How to advertise and promote what you offer with your podcast</p> <p>Michael explains how he originally started with ads on the front end, where he knew he had the maximum number of people listening for him to connect with.</p> <p>However, someone graciously suggested to him that he should give before he expects to receive.

That's increased exposure for your organization.</p> <p>John says that exposure starts by getting your current community, the people who already love you, to engage first.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how the news feed algorithm impacts engagement. </p> <p>How Facebook page managers should spur engagement </p> <p>John wants to change the word posting to planting because when you plant something, like a bush, you have to stick around and take care of it. If you post an update on Facebook, you want to pay attention to how it's performing. If people are commenting, liking and sharing, you want to be involved in that comment thread.</p> <p>Recalling Amy Porterfield's words from a few weeks ago, John says the more people notice that you stick around, the more they'll engage with your content.</p> <p>John agrees that community management on Facebook comes down to identifying the best-performing content, then tweaking and experimenting with content to optimize how you're posting, topics, times that you're posting, etc.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear what you’re missing by not interacting with what people are saying on your Facebook page.</p> <p>The Talking About This metric and how it's calculated</p> <p>John explains this metric as anything that a Facebook user does to create a story in their news feed for their friends to see.</p> <p>He says that when a user shares something, likes a page, RSVPs to an event a page has published or tags that page in a photo or a status update, all of these actions put content into the news feed of that user's friends so that they become aware. It's really what you might call viral reach.</p> <p>Anything that creates viral reach is Talking About This.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn more about Talking About This.</p> <p>How a Facebook page used engagement to achieve a goal</p> <p>Three years ago, the Brain Aneurysm Foundation was doing Facebook upside-down.

To free up some time, he decided to switch his clients to WordPress, which would give them the ability to change their own text and not have to contact him directly.</p> <p>Once this change happened, Syed was still approached with the same questions about WordPress. At the time there was no other WordPress resource site out there for beginners. So WPBeginner was formed on July 4, 2009.</p> <p>Syed explains how his goal in the beginning was to produce multiple posts a day and answer all of the questions that he was asked. The idea was to put the answers on the website so he could link back to them, rather than send an email.</p> <p>When he noticed that other people were using the site, he knew there was definitely a market for it.</p> <p>You'll hear how Syed used Twitter to help with content creation and why he used Digg and StumbleUpon to push articles.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why it was Syed's goal to help individuals, rather than have hugely popular articles.</p> <p>WPBeginner's site metrics</p> <p>Syed states that WPBeginner gets an average of 1.5 million page views a month and they have just over 70,000 followers on Twitter.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how these figures are similar to Social Media Examiner's.</p> <p>The lessons learned about content creation</p> <p>From the very beginning, Syed built an email list, but he didn't engage with it. At first, he didn't realize the value of asking people to ask you questions.</p> <p>Now when you subscribe to WPBeginner, it asks you one question: "What is the one thing we can help you with right now?"</p> <p>You'll discover why there is huge value in this one question and how this has changed the way WPBeginner creates content.</p> <p>Syed used to be the only person who wrote articles, but the site now has multiple writers with a very good editorial workflow.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how the interaction and response to email has developed the WPBeginner community.</p> <p>WPBeginner's business model</p> <p>Syed explains that his business is monetized through building WordPress applications and plugins. A lot of the time, it's conversion marketing for clients.</p> <p>The WPBeginner brand allows them to position themselves as experts. Whenever somebody wants a WordPress company to work with, they automatically think of WPBeginner.</p> <p>You'll hear how they use affiliate links for paid plugins.</p> <p>In the beginning, Syed tried display advertising.

They have 200 million active users every day, which is really impressive when up against Facebook's 1 billion–plus accounts.</p> <p>The thing that made Twitter cool in the first place is its simplicity. It remains relevant because it's where people gather.

He likes to tweet from Instagram and can post from his Instagram account to Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Foursquare, all at the same time.</p> <p>Twitter only allows 140 characters, so when you use pictures, it can be a lot of bonus words. Even mundane pictures can get a lot of interaction.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear an example of a picture that Joel used that made him realize there's a lot of power in mundane tweets.</p> <p>How Joel uses Twitter today to grow his platform </p> <p>Joel has started to check out more of what people on his stream have to say and then reshares their content. He does this more than tweeting his own original content. It's the giver mentality.</p> <p>A couple of Twitter's strengths are the retweet and the favorite. They're great opportunities to focus on the value that others bring.</p> <p>There are days when Joel doesn't tweet at all. Other days, he can get 5 or 6 tweets in. It all depends on what's happening that particular day. You should never just tweet for the sake of tweeting.</p> <p>When it comes to a tweeting strategy, you'll discover why it's important to be true to yourself and be aware of the types of businesses Twitter works best for.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Joel generally uses the standard retweet over a customized retweet.</p> <p>How to grow a quality Twitter following</p> <p>Joel advises starting with absolutely nothing.

He's also the CEO of VaynerMedia. His newest book is Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook: How to Tell Your Story in a Noisy World.</p> <p>Gary shares why storytelling is important for your business.</p> <p>You'll learn how to discover deeper data and why analytics are an essential part of your social strategy.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Story as Strategy<br /> The story behind Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook</p> <p>Gary explains how he had an epiphany that he might have let people down by over-indexing the act of giving in The Thank You Economy. Although he knew his readers would understand that to give is great, they wouldn't necessarily understand that at some stage you have to ask.</p> <p>The book title, Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook, stands for Give, Give, Give, Ask. You have to remember to give value, which eventually leads to putting out a good call to action, which leads to business. Gary says that even some of the best social media people don't know how to ask for business.</p> <p>The idea behind the book was for it to be a utility for people. It looks at individual pieces of content as case studies.</p> <p>You'll hear why Gary wanted to write a how-to book and why the title is a boxing metaphor.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Gary looks at social media as a science.</p> <p>What boxing teaches us about social media marketing</p> <p>Gary explains that it's the crossroads of the analytics and being creative to create business results.</p> <p>He feels like a lot of social media experts don't put enough effort into analyzing data. Gary didn't put in the effort either until he started VaynerMedia. Now he has seven full-time analysts. This has given him a much deeper insight into the black-and-white of it all.</p> <p>There are also people who think it's all algorithmic. They underestimate the value of the human touch and creative, which is the art. Analysis is the science. It's the crossroads of the two.</p> <p>Most social media marketers don't look deep into their analytics because of time or capacity. Most are consumed by speaking, consulting and selling content. Gary feels that it's time and money that hold most people back. This is why he wanted to share his ideas.</p> <p>Gary recommends that you use Facebook analytics to test for deeper data. It's a great tool that has a ton of uses.</p> <p>You need to think about and test what you put on your Facebook page and Twitter.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Gary likes to isolate himself into 'doing' versus 'consuming.'</p> <p>Common traps marketers fall into when it comes to social media</p> <p>Gary advises that you need to be careful and be able to back up what you say.</p> <p>He believes that he gets away with a lot of stuff because of the huge success he has had with Wine Library TV. Plus VaynerMedia is an eight-figure business already, where the number of employees has grown from 25 to 300.</p> <p>You'll find out why self-awareness is important and what else you need to consider when you want to help people.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why execution matters.</p> <p>Why storytelling is important</p> Do you use storytelling in your business?

It's a search engine and bookmarking site all in one.</p> <p>It's great if you want to bring exposure to your online content, which can include your website, blog post, video or infographic.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8DtI9e4xZ8</p> <p>Nick believes that the key differentiator with StumbleUpon is the Stumble button. It takes you directly to a piece of content on another website that you are interested in.</p> <p>You can tell StumbleUpon what your interests are in several ways. When you set up your profile, you can specify your interests, the interests of people you follow and what pieces of content you have given a thumbs-up to on that particular website.</p> <p>When you click the Thumbs-Up or Thumbs-Down button, it tells StumbleUpon's algorithm if it should or shouldn't serve that type of content to you in the future.</p> <p>Each person's StumbleUpon experience is personalized. It allows you to curate content, promote your content and connect with communities with all types of interests.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how you can create content that's relevant to an audience within an Interest category.</p> <p>StumbleUpon for B2B and B2C</p> <p>Nick believes that any business in B2B or B2C can use the platform. It all depends on the type of content you produce. The content needs to entertain, be informative and connect with your audience.</p> <p>To be successful, you need to test and measure, based on the changes you learn.</p> <p>StumbleUpon launched their new design and a new mobile app, which has increased its mobile stumbles by 25% over a one-year period. However, the majority of StumbleUpon activity is still primarily desktop, at over 60%.</p> <p>Since these changes were made, around 40% of their activity comes from mobile. In the next couple of years, Nick thinks it will easily overtake desktop.</p> <p>You'll discover as a marketer what you need to consider with these figures in mind.</p> <p>According to Alexa, StumbleUpon is one of the top 149 websites in the world and Quantcast estimated that 23.4 million people in the last month in the U.S. alone have used it.</p> <p>As of June 2013, when the StumbleUpon for Dummies book was published, StumbleUpon had 25 million registered users. They have indexed over 100 million–plus web pages.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how much the average user "stumbles" per month and the time spent on the platform.</p> <p>Companies who use StumbleUpon well </p> <p>Nick says that two companies come to mind, which are both primarily content publishers.</p> <p>The first is Forbes.

His books include You Are a Writer, Wrecked and The In-Between.</p> <p>Jeff shares how he achieved his dream of becoming a writer, while building a successful business.</p> <p>You'll learn what it takes to jump from blog to book and why you should start now.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Blog to Book to Business<br /> What do you tell people you do for a living?</p> <p>Jeff typically tells people he's a writer, although he does a lot of other things. He finds it easier to tell people that, and it allows him to own his identity.</p> <p>Jeff called himself a writer well before he was writing. It allowed him to step into the title and it reminds him of how far he has come.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear why many aspiring authors don't own their dreams.</p> <p>The story of dreams and fears</p> <p>Jeff explains that he went solo about 8-9 months ago, but it has taken him about 3 years to get to this stage.</p> <p>He originally started with a blog, which turned into a side business. It wasn't until the end of last year that he realized he was making enough money that his wife didn't have to work anymore. He eventually quit his job at the beginning of this year to become a full-time writer, blogger and speaker.</p> <p>Jeff's blog, Goins Writer, isn't his first blog. Up to this point, he had attempted eight other blogs, all of which failed.</p> <p>It was these failures that prepared Jeff to persevere. He eventually set up his personal blog, where he talks about writing and his own struggles. This was an attempt to learn how to build a platform so he could get published and share his journey with others.</p> <p>You'll hear why Jeff forced himself into writing a personal blog and why he made the decision to give it two years.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what fuels Jeff's writing.</p> <p>The importance of writing for more popular blogs</p> <p>When he started a blog, Jeff did the relationship thing first. You'll discover what he did to reach out to the people he admired and why they were a huge influence when it came to the launch of the Goins Writer blog.</p> <p>Once he had seen the power of this in action, he was able to partner with communicators who had audiences that he wanted to connect with.</p> <p>Within the first year of his blog's launch, Jeff wrote over 100 articles on 100 websites. He believes it was the single best strategy for building his audience.</p> <p>Every multi-author blog out there constantly looks for exceptional talent and it's a win-win for both parties. It was one of the keys to Jeff's success.</p> <p>Jeff had listened to people like Jon Morrow, who had essentially done the same thing. Jon didn't have a blog for years. Instead he established himself first as a guest author for other blogs, including CopyBlogger and ProBlogger. So before he even wrote a single post on his own blog, he already had an email list of about 13,000 subscribers.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear what Jeff discovered when he gave away his best content.</p> <p>Making money</p> Do you dream of writing a book?

It's what people in social media, email marketing and even mobile have been doing, but he approaches it from a different angle.</p> <p>When Jeff talked to marketers about their audiences, which included Facebook fans, Twitter followers, YouTube subscribers and email subscribers, they didn't seem to have a strategy. In most cases, strategy was an afterthought or the outcome of a momentary campaign.</p> <p>Marketing was traditionally organized around a campaign. Jeff refers to it as a beginning, a middle and an end, then a cake to celebrate the results and then repeat it.</p> <p>You'll discover why audience development is a responsibility, primary to marketing.</p> <p>Originally marketers delivered the promise via email, but now you have to take that style of thinking into the social and mobile channels. Proprietary audiences will only be there if you build them. If not, you'll have to pay in the form of advertising.</p> <p>Jeff's message is to take a look at everything you do in marketing and try to optimize it to build a proprietary audience, because it gives you a huge competitive advantage.</p> <p>Before the Internet, creative thinkers only had to worry about great creative. They didn't have to assemble an audience because mass media did that for them.</p> <p>The difference today is not only coming up with the creative, but also thinking about distribution and building an audience that belongs to you—one that nobody else has access to. So when you have that great piece of content, you are able to push the button and reach your audience.</p> <p>You'll hear Jeff explain why it's important for businesses to have people in charge of audience development across all channels.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why proprietary audience development is the flipside of the content marketing coin.</p> <p>The definition of seekers, amplifiers and joiners</p> <p>Jeff explains that these are the three top-level audiences that marketers have exclusive access to.</p> <p>1. Seekers</p> <p>Seekers are people who look for information or for entertainment. For example, you're a seeker when you turn on your TV and flip through the channels to find something to entertain you.</p> <p>You're also a seeker when you use Google or Google Maps. Search engine optimization is all about the process of delivering seekers to your website.</p> <p>Seekers are momentary. Once they have their fill of entertainment or find the information they need, they go away without a trace.</p> Do you use social media to build an audience for your business?

However, social media and LinkedIn in particular have changed this. You'll hear why Viveka loves prospecting.</p> <p>Social media has changed us from the age of the seller to the age of the consumer. Consumers now tell us want they want. A large part of prospecting is to know who your ideal clients are and know their needs. Facebook, Yelp, LinkedIn and Twitter make the research a lot easier.</p> <p>As a seller, it's also a lot easier and cheaper to get out there and position yourself as a thought leader. This engenders the feeling of "know, like and trust" in a client or prospect with whom you may not have had direct interaction. It makes it easier to close the sale.</p> <p>In Jill Konrath's book, Selling to BIG Companies, she talks about how you have to know whom to sell to. This is why LinkedIn is so important—it tells you who works at the companies, their positions and whom they interact with. It enables you to reach out to the right person.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why groups can be so powerful.</p> <p>LinkedIn for prospecting</p> <p>Viveka explains the two aspects of prospecting—inbound and outbound. Actively prospecting is just a matter of research.</p> <p>With a combination of keywords, titles, company name and location, you can use the Advanced Search on LinkedIn to discover the people you want to interact with. These are your prospects.</p> <p>You'll hear about some of the great benefits of LinkedIn and also some of its limitations.</p> <p>One of the most powerful search categories is Location. Not only can you see who lives in your town, but also when you attend trade shows or conferences, it's a great way to connect with people before the event.</p> <p>A really cool app that you can use for conferences is Bizzabo, which has a LinkedIn API interface. There are thousands of events in there and you can see who will be at the event. It shows you their LinkedIn profile. In the show, you'll also discover another app which can be used for prospecting.</p> <p>If you want to meet prospects face to face before an event, a cool new app called Trendr will set up a live meeting place.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how you can discover if a prospect is active in a particular LinkedIn group.</p> <p>Viveka's experience on LinkedIn</p> <p>Viveka is extremely active on LinkedIn, either prospecting or inbound. She says that 70-80% of her business comes through LinkedIn and the remainder through things that she markets on Twitter.</p> Do you use LinkedIn for your business?

Successful media companies produce great content and Michael says that brands need to think the same way.</p> <p>If you think about traditional media companies such as Condé Nast, it has a very diverse story and narrative. No matter what the subject is, a consistent story is shared across paid, earned and owned media.</p> <p>When you start to dissect what they do at Condé Nast, they are actually storytellers.</p> <p>As a brand, you need to figure out what story you want to tell and then figure out how to tell it. It's not just for social platforms, but across every form of the customer experience. This can include paid advertising.</p> <p>You have to think of every customer touch point for your business. Media companies are very good at having a consistent story across each touch point.</p> <p>You'll hear how brands have a lot of power within their own companies to tell a story. You just need to figure out the right operational framework to make it come to life.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what Forbes did that started to grab Michael's attention 3-4 years ago.</p> <p>Businesses that have become media via their content and platform</p> <p>Michael gives an example of a brand in the consumer space, B2B space and small business space.</p> <p>A company that's in the consumer space is Red Bull. Red Bull is definitely a media company that has a very diverse narrative, and it's not about energy drinks. It's more to do with epic events and empowerment. It's another brand that is consistent across all channels.</p> <p>Red Bull has its own in-house media agency that creates compelling content day in and day out, with the consistent message, "Red Bull Gives You Wings."</p> <p>When Red Bull helped Felix Baumgartner do a space dive, the brand was mentioned for months after the event. The story was told through visual content and long-form content, both paid and owned media.</p> <p>You'll hear why Michael believes that brands should capitalize on long-form content.</p> <p>Intel, a company in the B2B space, capitalized on its employees' passion for Intel's products. Today it's referred to as brand journalism. Consumers trust employees of a company, which especially helps when it comes to purchases.</p> <p>The small business example is a company based in San Francisco called Visage that does enterprise mobility software. Its Chief Mobility Officer blog talks about enterprise mobility and not about the company.

At the time, I had spoken at Ann's conferences and written for MarketingProfs on white papers and white paper marketing. The response I received back from Ann in hindsight was very important to me. You'll hear the question Ann asked me and how I responded.</p> <p>I also noticed that Brian Clark at Copyblogger had started to get excited about Twitter. I'd also written for Copyblogger since they were my target audience.</p> <p>So I decided to take Twitter on and approached Brian to see if I could write an article about it. The article was titled "How to Use Twitter to Grow Your Business."</p> <p>A few months later I reached out to Ann Handley and she agreed for me to write an article called "The Dark Side of Twitter: What Businesses Need to Know."</p> <p>Although I knew nothing about either subject, you'll hear how I developed these articles and hopefully you'll see that you can do it too.</p> <p>These articles were published when the market was ready for them and part of the success was because of the people who shared it.</p> <p>Take-home lessons:</p> <p> Experimenting on someone else's platform allows you to make sure that your content will be popular before you decide to either build a new platform with this type of content or start to introduce that content into your existing platform.<br /> Almost anyone is approachable for a journalistic opportunity. When you write for a known platform that is large in your industry, you can leverage your visibility to connect with people. It's an incredible opportunity for you to get some great content.<br /> You can set the stage for something big.</p> <p>The success of these articles is what justified starting Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out the other great benefits of when you publish content on someone else's platform.<br /> #2: Do a reverse Trojan horse<br /> In the tale of the Trojan horse where the warriors are released, I want you to reverse it and instead think about gathering data while other people march you around.</p> <p>In January 2009, I conducted the Social Media Marketing Industry Survey, where hundreds of marketers were asked to complete a very simple survey. In exchange for that information, they received the completed report.</p> <p>This data converted into a rich 26-page PDF file, known as the Social Media Marketing Industry Report.</p> <p>You'll find out the type of questions I asked and what the real goal was behind the survey.</p> <p>Within weeks of this report's publication, over 40,000 people downloaded it and made more than 400 comments. One of the unintended benefits for me was to become the first person to "claim an industry" in this space.</p> <p>Take-home lessons:</p> <p> Make sure there is value or a benefit to everyone who participates.<br /> Do you want to build a respectable platform?

The essence of the video is a scarecrow who works for a big corporation that's in the business of processing food. He soon realizes that he doesn't like the world he's in and decides to make things using healthy alternatives.</p> <p>At the end of the video, Chipotle has included a video game for viewers. Their brand is only mentioned at the very end for a few seconds. It's received a lot of press.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUtnas5ScSE</p> <p>Joe says that it pulls at the heartstrings a bit and if you can do that in marketing, it's great. This isn't the first time Chipotle has done this. They did Back to the Start in 2011, which was a similar movement.</p> <p>You'll discover why in 2011 Joe would have said this was creative marketing/advertising and why today it's an approach to storytelling. And now it's fully fledged content marketing. The story is bigger than Chipotle, as they don't talk about their products or services. Joe believes more of this type of content marketing will be seen in the future.</p> <p>One of the keys to content marketing is consistency. You need to take a 24/7 approach to telling stories to attract and retain your customers. This is exactly what Chipotle has done. They found their bigger story and began a movement around it.</p> <p>Although considered long for a YouTube video at 3 minutes 23 seconds, Joe believes that if you tell a story it doesn't matter how long it is.</p> <p>You'll hear why Chipotle agonized over whether to include the chili pepper in the video, which is part of their brand.</p> <p>If you think about what stories you can tell, they should not be about you but rather something you stand for, which will make a difference in your customers' lives.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Chipotle's goal was to get their video out into social media.</p> <p>How content marketing works</p> <p>Over the last 50 years, advertisers interrupted people's attention with their advertisements. Today's content marketing is not about distracting the customer; it's to attract them with useful content.</p> <p>You need to provide valuable, relevant and compelling content and deliver it consistently. People then grow relationships with you because they see you as the trusted source for that particular content. This can then lead to sales.</p> <p>It can look like a daily blog, a podcast, a quarterly magazine, a weekly newsletter or even a TV show. You have to be the producer of the content and create an asset.</p> <p>Content marketing happens when businesses start to think like publishers and deliver compelling content to a defined readership. Do you use content marketing for your business? Are you wondering how to attract customers with your content?

He's a social media consultant and coach. His newest book is Maximize Your Social: A One-Stop Guide to Building a Social Media Strategy for Marketing and Business Success.</p> <p>Neal shares the unique insights he gained while working overseas with companies that had to build their sales organizations from scratch.</p> <p>You'll learn the core elements your social strategy needs to be successful and sustainable.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Social Media Marketing Plan<br /> Many marketers are solely focused on the 'how' rather than the 'why' of social media</p> <p>Neal states that you should operate with a plan. The most precious resource for a marketer is time. Social media can drain your time, especially with the emergence of new platforms.</p> <p>You need to have a plan—and more importantly, an objective—and be able to measure what you are doing. For a small business it's one thing, but if you are doing it on behalf of a client or a brand/company, they want to know what they will get out of their social media budget.</p> <p>As social media becomes a mass skill, Neal thinks we'll see a lot more corporate oversight into what people do in social media.</p> <p>If you concentrate on the tactics alone, then the value of a Facebook like is meaningless. It might be a secondary metric, but at the end of the day, you need to know how it affects your business objectives. If you just look at the tactics, you completely miss the whole business picture.</p> <p>As a small business owner, it's easy to get caught up in the numbers. There is more focus on the 'how,' because you can be too concerned about trying to keep up with everyone else.</p> <p>You'll hear Neal give an example of a hotel client's Facebook strategy and how it's not all about the number of likes you have compared to your competitors.</p> <p>Likes are important to companies that want to get brand recognition in the marketplace—although it's not a business objective, it's more brand awareness.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why the number of likes is only one indicator in comparing yourself to your competition.</p> <p>How working abroad helped Neal in the new world of social media</p> <p>After graduating from college, Neal moved to Japan, where he helped three companies in the high-tech industry. Neal says it provided him with a lot of extremely holistic business experience.</p> <p>He had to launch their sales organizations from scratch and had to figure out how to get brand recognition across different countries in markets where they weren't known.</p> <p>These jobs included sales and marketing, attending conferences, hiring people, dealing with legal issues and offering customer support. All of these roles led Neal to a very holistic view of social media in terms of not just using it for marketing but throughout the enterprise.</p> <p>You'll hear why storytelling helped strengthen these Chinese brands and Japanese technology.</p> <p>Neal gained unique insights while working with these companies and it has given him a way to look at things in a practical, Do you have a social media plan?

He's a consultant who's worked with brands like Nike and Motorola. Simon also hosts the upcoming We First Social Branding Seminar in West Hollywood in a few days.</p> <p>Simon shares the importance of tapping into the power of your fans to share your story.</p> <p>You'll learn how you can create a story and the kind of content you need to use to succeed.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Social Sharing<br /> Why is it important to tap the power of fans?</p> <p>Simon states that the power of social media is not in the ability of a brand to sell directly to a customer; it's more to inspire a customer who made a purchase to talk about your brand to others.</p> <p>With traditional media, it was "one to many." A television commercial would reach many people. Whereas with social media, it's about "one to one to many." Kevin Kelly, co-founder of Wired magazine, said, "One member of those thousand fans and those thousand fans will promote you to so many other people."</p> <p>Apple's marketing looks effortless, but they do very conscious things to build their rabid fan base.</p> <p>They celebrate the customer through the priority they give to the user experience. There is no other brand out there that spends so much time and attention to make sure their customer experience is so well-captured in the product itself.</p> <p>Apple really listens to their customers and the marketing is done in a very human way. The video below shows the campaign for the iPod, which was done in very simple language.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaVFCdwT0hk</p> <p>You'll discover what else Apple does to tap into the human dynamics and how they have a raving fan base.</p> <p>Not everybody has the brilliance of what Apple has built and Simon says there is a fundamental shift that every brand needs to make.</p> <p>The shift is for companies to market themselves not as the celebrity of their customer community but rather as a celebrant. You have to stop talking about yourself. Instead talk about your customers. Now thanks to social media, there is real-time dialog between brands and consumers.</p> <p>If you want to inspire your fans to promote your brand and build your business, you need to reframe your marketing as a celebration of your customer community. You'll hear the questions you need to think about that get customers to share and what gives you the power of one to one to many. You can then use your marketing platform to celebrate your customers.</p> <p>There are many entrepreneurs and big brands that transform their experience with social media. Brands have changed their positioning and it's become a benefit to their customers.</p> <p>Coca-Cola's marketing used to be "The Real Thing." Now they've changed it to "Open Happiness." Pepsi was "The Joy of Pepsi," and now it's "Refresh Everything."</p> <p>You'll hear how Sharpie celebrates their customers and what Intel did to make it all about their customers with the launch of the Museum of Me.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how the direction of conve...

With the Internet, people can hide behind the anonymity of Google search.</p> <p>You can do all your pre-purchase research without having to talk to a salesperson. You only have to talk to a person once you've made a short list of companies you are interested in and want to close the deal.</p> <p>Today's buyer prefers this process, as it's easier and more efficient. With this in mind, companies have to adjust.</p> <p>In the early days, the power was with the salesperson, but with the knowledge available online today, the power is in the hands of the consumer.</p> <p>Tom says as a business, you have to stop thinking about how you sell because you don't really sell anymore. Instead you help buyers make a buying decision. When they make their decision, hopefully it will be in your favor. Although it won't always be the case.</p> <p>You'll discover how your system needs to be set up properly and the approach you need to consider.</p> <p>If you have a really good product or service, more often than not, you will win the conversion. Most people are turned off by people selling to them. The best way is to show them that you're willing to help and that you always have their best interests at heart.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out more about how the approach to sales has changed.</p> <p>An example of a business that has embraced new ways to sell</p> <p>Tom talks about a camera store called Adorama based in New York that he used as a case study in his book, The Invisible Sale. Adorama only has one store, but does business in all 50 US states and 5 countries.</p> <p>Adorama has two sides to their business, B2C and B2B. Regardless of which side you look at, they approach it the same way. Their philosophy is to sell by sharing original educational content.</p> <p>Even though it's a photography store, they sell more than just cameras. They've built a Learning Center that includes Adorama TV, which is one of their huge content pieces. The Learning Center is a treasure trove of educational content.</p> <p>Although their approach is to educate, when you watch one of their videos, you'll notice easy-to-follow links to products below the video. You'll find out how they used YouTube to allow people to reach that product.</p> <p>In 2010, they saw a general growth curve, mainly due to the educational content they provide.</p> <p>The moral of the lesson is that if you can make your buyer smarter and better because they are doing business with you, then Tom believes you will succeed in selling more to that buyer.</p> Do you use social media to grow your business?

Google describes it as a unification of their video, chats and messenger service all in one place. It was a replacement for Google talk and Google chat.</p> <p>Hangouts can either be private or you can stream live to your YouTube channel with Hangouts on Air.</p> <p>Brandee explains that if you're a consultant or coach, you can use hangouts like you would Skype. The quality of the video is amazing.</p> <p>If you want to record your private hangout sessions, then you will have to use Camtasia or ScreenFlow. These hangouts are great to use for team meetings, consulting, coaching or when you privately advise people.</p> <p>With a hangout on air, you can host yourself and up to nine other people. You can all be on the video at the same time, where you can chat and give a presentation. This can be done with private hangouts and hangouts on air.</p> <p>You'll discover why you need to keep control of the sound-activated screen and what you need to do.</p> <p>Hangouts on air stream live to your YouTube channel. It's linked to your Google+ page. If you have a Google+ profile or a Google+ business page, you link it to your YouTube channel.</p> <p>You need to have your YouTube channel verified for uploads of more than 15 minutes and most hangouts run longer than that.</p> <p>The great advantage when you stream live to your YouTube channel is that at the end of the broadcast, you have unlimited YouTube content. You'll find out what you need to add once you have finished the live stream to be able to optimize your video marketing.</p> <p>When you stream live, it also runs on your Google+ profile page at the same time. Once you start a hangout on air, you can take the embed codes and share them on a Facebook tab, website or blog post. You can then direct people to watch it there.</p> <p>There's also a Hangouts on Air page that lists all of the hangouts that are currently on air.</p> <p>Listen to the show to learn about how you should name your hangouts to grab people's attention.</p> <p>How does a hangout differ from a webinar?</p> <p>Brandee first saw hangouts as a possible replacement for webinars. A lot of the webinar platforms are expensive and if you only do a few, it can be hard to justify the cost. Many webinar platforms base their price on the number of viewers. But with a hangout on air, you have unlimited viewership.</p> <p>Brandee explains how she has done webinars by herself with a slide presentation embedded on a website that has unlimited viewers.</p> <p>With hangouts on air, you don't need to buy expensive plugins for your website. People can enter their email address and then flip over to a Watch Live page.</p> <p>You'll discover the best option to help build e... Do you use Google+ hangouts for your marketing?

She became curious when her twin daughters were using it.</p> <p>Sue shares that one of the reasons why marketers should consider Instagram is because it's mobile. It's a great way for your business to communicate directly with people with whom you want to build trust and credibility. There's no better way for people to see what you are up to.</p> <p>Instagram is a free mobile app, which you can download onto your iPhone or Android phone. It allows you to share photos or videos with your target market. It's very quick, easy and fun to use.

Sue has a very active Pinterest account, which is also very successful for her boutique.</p> <p>Both Pinterest and Instagram have grown into their own thriving communities.</p> <p>With Instagram, you can tell a story with both photos and videos. As soon as you upload an Instagram image, you can see within seconds that someone has liked it. With Pinterest however, you tell people what you like. You curate your boards and highlight what you like from things that are already online.</p> <p>Sue gives an example of how she is able to seize opportunities presented to her with customers in her boutique. It's a great way to create a fun mood.</p> <p>The hashtags that you use to describe the image or the video are how people follow you or find you.</p> <p>You'll hear what hashtags Sue uses at an event and why it helps create more interaction. You have to remember that people look for certain hashtags for their industry to stay top of mind.</p> <p>From a business perspective, when an image grabs your attention, you can choose to click into the account and see if you want to follow the person. Once you start to follow an account, it will show up in your feed. You can also unfollow accounts at any time.</p> <p>Sue believes that she can put a visual strategy together for any kind of business. You'll hear the different types of businesses she has worked with.</p> <p>In the B2B world, it's not necessarily about the products you sell, it's about visual feelings. Images of sunsets, nature and oceans get a lot of likes because they are visually pleasing. It's not just about business.</p> Do you use Instagram for your business?

In the past, it was hard to try to use YouTube as a business tool. Back then, people used it for different reasons. Today businesses have started to wake up to the opportunities.</p> <p> YouTube's statistics show more than 1 billion unique users to their site each month. There's over 6 billion hours of video watched each month on YouTube. That's almost an hour for every person on earth. This number has increased by 50% from last year. There are 100 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute.</p> <p>According to Nielsen, YouTube reaches more U.S. adults ages 18–34 than any other cable network.</p> <p>When you take these statistics into account, you can see where your potential target audience is. YouTube is also an amazing tool to make good connections with your audience.</p> <p>Now that people can consume video on their smartphones, the mobile uptake has been phenomenal.</p> <p>Gideon shares how more and more people have started to watch YouTube videos on their television screens.</p> <p>If you look at videos that went viral on YouTube in 2012, 8 out of 10 were not your average cat or baby video, they were all professionally produced by someone who knew what they were doing. It's a sign that the game has changed on YouTube.</p> <p>Gideon believes we are still at the start of the game when it comes to the opportunity available for business exposure.</p> <p>Our 2013 Social Media Marketing Industry Report shows that 69% of marketers plan on increasing their YouTube marketing in 2013.</p> <p>You'll hear Gideon's story of how he got started with YouTube and discovered how it was good for business.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why there are no competitors on YouTube, only collaborators.</p> <p>What you should think about when planning your YouTube strategy</p> <p>Gideon states that you need to be very strategic when you set up your YouTube channels. A lot of people think that it's about the views, but that's not the case.</p> <p>When Gideon thinks about his own strategy and when he helps others, he always starts with the Hedgehog Concept. You'll learn how this concept relates to two different kinds of businesses.</p> <p>The concept is defined as the overlap of three things:</p> <p> Your area of passion<br /> Your area of skill or the thing that you can become the best at<br /> How you can make money from it</p> <p>When these three things overlap like a Venn diagram, the middle is your Hedgehog Concept. You'll learn how this can help you identify your target audience's needs. Do you use video in your marketing? Are you wondering how YouTube can help promote your business? To learn about how to get started with marketing your business with YouTube, I interview Gideon Shalwick for this episode of the Social Media Marketing po... clean 53:27 Facebook Contests: How to Get Your Fans Excited http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-contests-how-to-get-your-fans-excited/ Fri, 16 Aug 2013 10:00:58 +0000 http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/?p=43665 <p>Have you ever run a Facebook contest?</p> <p>Are you wondering if you should use them for your business?</p> <p>To learn about Facebook contests, I interview Andrea Vahl for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.<br /> More About This Show</p> <p>The Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>The show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).</p> <p>In this episode, I interview Andrea Vahl, co-author of Facebook Marketing All-in-One for Dummies.

You'll hear the benefits of each and the best types of prizes to give away.</p> <p> Help grow the likes on your page and your Facebook presence<br /> Grow your email list<br /> Help promote a product you're selling</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how we did a photo contest called Help Me Launch.</p> <p>Examples of successful contests</p> <p>Andrea shares a few success stories with Facebook contests and what range of prizes can develop good success.</p> <p>Andrea helped set up a contest for a client on Facebook called Chocolate for Breakfast. It was a contest where the giveaway was a small box of premium chocolate truffles.</p> <p>The contest was run for one week. From this, the client got 700 new fans and 400 email addresses. At the time, the page was at the early stages with around 1200 fans. So for the cost of the premium box of chocolates, the client got a huge response.</p> <p>The contest was on the client's Facebook tab (like you're supposed to do), and it required people to like the page to enter.</p> <p>Discover how a contest on a tab works and what information people need to enter to participate.</p> <p>It was a sweepstakes contest where you didn't have to enter any photos, essay or video. It was a random-draw winner with anyone eligible to win.</p> <p>You'll hear how it was promoted and the frequency of the posts.</p> <p>Another client of Andrea's, Camp Bow Wow, did a contest called Bad to the Bone. They're a doggy daycare facility and also have home buddies dog training courses that they give away.</p> <p>This contest encouraged people to submit pictures of their bad dogs. People would then vote on who was the baddest dog. The winner would get a free year of dog training lessons, which was a great prize.</p> <p>Hear how this contest was run over a couple of stages and why it lasted about a year.</p> <p>It was a huge success, with over 15,000 new fans.</p> <p>Andrea encourages people to think about how you can piggyback on different techniques that have worked well. Create some fun around the contest and engage with your audience.</p> <p>A bigger brand that ran a contest was Eggo. They did a Waffle-Off, which encouraged people to submit recipes with Eggo waffles.</p> <p>People would submit recipes and show you the various ways to enjoy Eggo waffles.</p> <p>It was user-generated content and photos. People were very engaged with the contest. It was easy to set up and it took off for Eggo.</p> Have you ever run a Facebook contest? Are you wondering if you should use them for your business?

You'll discover how to find the right people to follow and the most popular boards around your niche.</p> <p>Ian shares what replacement he uses for Digg and why it's a good source of content.</p> <p>Ian uses a tool within Facebook called Post Planner.

He liked to listen to podcasts and soon ran out of content to listen to.</p> <p>At the time, Pat Flynn had his Smart Passive Income podcast, for which he released one episode every two weeks.</p> <p>John soon realized that if he was running out of content, then so were others. He had the idea to start Entrepreneur on Fire as a 7-day-a-week podcast featuring interviews with today's most inspiring and successful entrepreneurs.</p> <p>In the beginning, John approached Jamie Tardy, The Eventual Millionaire, for mentoring. She agreed but thought he was crazy to commit to 7 days a week. Jamie thought it would be too much for his listeners to consume.</p> <p>John also joined Cliff Ravencraft's Podcast Mastermind and was told the exact same thing.</p> <p>You'll hear what John did with the advice from mentors and people already in that space.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear the fears and doubts John had, and still has today.</p> <p>Pat, in the early days what were some of your fears?</p> <p>Pat shares the fears he faced when he first started out. One of the them was that the work wouldn't be appreciated or seen and whether it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>One of the biggest was the fear of failure and looking bad. When he was first let go from his job, he had the fear of not being able to provide for his family. He wanted to go down the path that was good for his and his family's future.</p> <p>You'll discover the kind of support Pat received from his wife, family and mentors. It helped him face the fear, doubt and resistance he encountered and got him to take action.</p> <p>When he wrote his first ebook in 2008, which was aimed at the architecture industry, he feared that nobody would buy it. This is one of the things that could have easily stopped him from writing the ebook.</p> <p>The take-home message is that you may not know John, Pat or me, but one thing is certain: We have all dealt with significant fear. We have all overcome it and gone on to do some pretty exciting things.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear my story of when I put my idea for a social media blog out to some extremely influential people. My idea became Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>What about the fear of missing out?</p> <p>John believes the fear of missing out is prevalent. As entrepreneurs, it's the bright, shiny object syndrome. You see all these amazing platforms that you want to try.</p> <p>With all this going on around him, John always tries to remain focused. Is fear holding you back in your business? Are you wondering what you can do to face your fears?

Maybe you email your subscribers when you have a new blog post or newsletter. Perhaps you have some sort of online form (for lead generation or just a simple contact form).</p> <p>Email indeed plays an important role for most businesses.</p> <p>Gmail is auto-filtering all emails for all users.</p> <p>This means your marketing newsletters and emails will get stuck in a slightly hidden folder, no matter what you do. In that very same folder, Gmail is posting unsolicited ads that look like emails.</p> <p>The bottom line with regards to these new Gmail tabs is that you will likely see a drop in your email marketing effectiveness unless you take action.</p> <p>In 2012, there were 425 million Gmail users. That's a huge number!</p> <p>Social Media Examiner has 75,000+ Gmail users. Yes, 34% of our readers subscribe through a Gmail account!</p> <p>There's a pretty good likelihood you have more Gmail users than you realize.<br /> What are Gmail tabs?<br /> Gmail is rolling out tabs that organize your mail.</p> <p>There are three default tabs: Primary, Social and Promotions (shown below).</p> <p>If you haven't already received this update on Gmail, it will likely come soon.</p> <p>Your emails are likely going into the Promotions tab.</p> <p>Tabs default "on" for all Gmail users unless your subscribers change this setting. If your subscribers don't know how to change it, this is how they will be finding your emails.</p> <p>At the time of this post, not all subscribers have tabs, but it is rolling out very quickly.<br /> What are the marketing implications?<br /> Gmail is becoming like Facebook.</p> <p>If you use it, you use it by their rules.</p> <p>I'm also concerned by the possibility that other email providers may follow Google's lead.</p> <p>This may be the beginning of the end of email as the one platform you can at least get delivery into.</p> <p>With social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, you can never be sure that your messages get in front of your audience.</p> <p>Email has always been the one way that you could be certain of getting in front of your audience, assuming subscribers gave you permission to send them emails.</p> <p>Will this change with Gmail tabs? I think so.</p> <p>The updates in the Promotions tab reset each time you visit Gmail, meaning it is very easy for a Gmail user to never realize there is mail waiting in the Promotions tab.</p> <p>Other email providers may follow suit. There could come a time when marketers will have to pay to play.<br /> Your 5-step plan for dealing with Gmail tabs</p> <p>Here are tips you can move on right now to help educate your Gmail readers.

She's the world's leading authority on Facebook marketing and author of The New Relationship Marketing and co-author of Facebook Marketing: An Hour a Day.</p> <p>Mari shares how the new Facebook features can work for your business and what you should pay attention to.

However, Mark Zuckerberg and his entire team do keep a very close eye on the competition.</p> <p>When it comes to features that have been around for a while, Facebook tends to be late with their release simply because they are a much bigger machine. They have a lot more complexity to deal with.</p> <p>With Facebook being a public company, they have to make money for their shareholders. They've made a lot of changes to their ad product and it seems like they move things around to try and get the marketers attention.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why most of the features are there to predominantly improve the monetization aspect.</p> <p>What Facebook hashtags are and why marketers should care</p> <p>Mari explains that the simple definition of a hashtag is that it's a way to group conversations together, around the same topic. This makes it easy to discover and follow conversations. Just like you see on Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Google+ and LinkedIn.</p> <p>If you think about TV ads 2-3 years ago, the call to action would be an invite to join the brand, where they would give out their Facebook Fanpage. Now the call to action is a hashtag.</p> <p>You'll hear Mari talk about the reason behind why some TV shows have niche hashtags appear throughout their broadcast, instead of one main hashtag.</p> <p>As a business owner you need to start to experiment with hashtags. Find one or two hashtags that can help you ride a wave. There's a term called newsjacking. It doesn't sound very nice but it's a very popular way to get your business in front of people who are talking about something anyway.</p> <p>The great thing about Facebook's hashtags, is that they are clickable. So if you click on any, whether it's on a Post or a Comment, it opens up into what is called the Hashtag Feed. This feed displays other posts with the same hashtag.</p> <p>However, recently they have introduced related searches into this feature. So not only will you see the exact verbatim hashtag but also similar ones.</p> <p>As a strategic marketer, Mari highly recommends every business owner make good use of hashtags. Even if you don't have them personally, they are active for other people.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how clickable hashtags can get you in front of new people.</p> <p>Tips and creative uses for Facebook hashtags</p> <p>Mari uses two generic Facebook hashtags which are #facebookmarketing and #facebooktips. Are you using Facebook for your business? Are you wondering how Facebook’s newest features can help your business? To learn about what these new Facebook features mean for marketers, I interview Mari Smith for this episode of the Social Media Marketing... clean 36:40 Monetize Your Platform: How to Grow Sales With Your Online Platform http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/monetize-your-platform-how-to-grow-sales-with-your-online-platform/ Fri, 19 Jul 2013 10:00:23 +0000 http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/?p=40912 <p>Have you built your own platform?</p> <p>Are you wondering how to monetize it?</p> <p>To learn how you can use your platform to generate real revenue for your business, I interview David Siteman Garland for this episode of the Social Media Marketing podcast.<br /> More About This Show</p> <p>The Social Media Marketing podcast is a show from Social Media Examiner.</p> <p>It's designed to help busy marketers and business owners discover what works with social media marketing.</p> <p>The show format is on-demand talk radio (also known as podcasting).</p> <p>In this episode, I interview David Siteman Garland, who is the host of The Rise To The Top podcast. His video and audio podcasts are focused on equipping bloggers, podcasters and YouTubers to grow a sustainable business with their platforms.

The platform space falls into two different categories.</p> <p>The first one is when it's a hobby. Here people have great content but don't know what to do with it.</p> <p>The second one is where you have the classic "Internet marketers" who have figured out how to make money but their content isn't great.</p> <p>David's advice to those who have great content but struggle to make money is you have to remember that you're positioned extremely well. If you have great content that's a side hobby, you can turn it into a legitimate six-figure–plus business.</p> <p>David started out the exact same way.

In David's eyes, the hard part is building your audience, community and trust. Once you have all this in place, the monetization angle can be brought in pretty easily.</p> <p>The hardest challenge is to start with no platform and no product. If you already have the platform, then you are 50% of the way there.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out how you can use technology to accomplish what traditionally businesses had to pay a lot of money for.</p> <p>What is the platform you have built? </p> <p>David started his platform The Rise To The Top in 2008, when it was a simple interview show for entrepreneurs. His show now focuses primarily on what he calls mediapreneurs, who are people with a platform.</p> <p>He currently has over 7 million community members.</p> <p>When David was on the journey of building his platform, he realized he was pretty good at creating content, building his audience and getting out there. The main struggle for him was how to turn it into a sustainable, long-term business.</p> <p>There are many ways to monetize a platform. It doesn't come down to which one will be best, it's more about which one you are really excited about and want to do. You have to feel comfortable with it.</p> <p>You'll discover the many ways you can monetize your platform.</p> <p>From a content perspective, David publishes two brand-new shows every week on his platform.

You should always have a strategy and more importantly, start early.</p> <p>The first thing I did with My Kids' Adventures was to come up with a cool code name, which was Project Torch. Once this was decided, I started to tease my Facebook personal profile friends.</p> <p>As soon as Project Torch was announced on Facebook, everybody wanted to know what it was about. I was teasing a sub-community of my larger community.</p> <p>You'll hear how it not only caused underground buzz with my employees at Social Media Examiner, but high-profile friends too. In marketing terminology, you'd call it the teaser phase.</p> <p>Whenever I start something new, I always go to the same place to do the initial planning. Here I made a short video of me saying that I was working on something new and very exciting. Implying I was in the same place I was when I started planning Social Media Examiner made people believe that it must be something big.</p> <p>httpv://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAnvWdojGXk</p> <p>Once I had written my notes on the new project, I took a photo with my iPhone and uploaded it to Photoshop to blur out the answers to my questions. This image was then put on my personal Facebook Page to tease my audience.</p> <p>I did the same thing with the Vision Statement. I blurred out about 70% of the words, leaving enough for people to try to figure it out. You'll also discover the other teasers I used on Facebook over the next few months.</p> <p>This got people interested and they wanted me to share with them what Project Torch was about. Everyone loves a mystery. The response I received was the motivation to keep going.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how the idea came about when I went to Disneyland last year.</p> <p>How to release more details</p> <p>Following the teaser stage, I moved on to what I call a super-soft release. Although I wasn't totally ready, I decided to make an announcement during my keynote at Social Media Marketing World in April this year. You'll discover why it was the ideal time to do t...

However, it requires you to understand why they are talking about some things rather than others.</p> <p>Following the rigorous academic research, Jonah decided to write the book Contagious to help people apply the insights, so their products and ideas could take off.</p> <p>Jonah explains how when the science was applied to a number of different companies to increase word of mouth in a given campaign, there was an increase of 20-50%.

His brand-new book is called Youtility: Why Smart Marketing Is About Help Not Hype.</p> <p>Jay shares the many different ways companies are already providing youtility to their customers.</p> <p>You'll learn the three categories of being useful and how to implement them into your business.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> New Marketing Techniques<br /> What's changing marketing that everybody needs to understand?</p> <p>Jay believes that marketing is harder than ever. With the incredible growth in the number of media outlets, it makes it very difficult to achieve top of mind awareness in the ways that we used to be able to do.</p> <p>Blogs and podcasts didn't exist before, but today they have huge audiences.</p> <p>Companies now have to compete for attention—not just against other companies, but against everybody and everything.</p> <p>Jay explains that if you take a look at your Facebook news feed, Twitter account or email inbox, you'll find a combination of both personal and professional relationships. Companies are competing for attention with consumers' friends and family members and are forced to use the same technologies to get on their radar.</p> <p>Since 1994, Jay has worked online and remembers how people freaked out when they bought advertising on the web for the first time. He says at the end of the day, all these things are almost free, but somebody has got to pay the free. The guys who pay the free are businesses.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out what you need to do to succeed against everyone and everything.</p> <p>The story about @HiltonSuggests and what the take-home message is for marketers</p> <p>Jay talks about certain people who are an exception to the rule when it comes to being amazing. But he feels that most of us aren't amazing. So the best approach for us all is to be useful.</p> <p>You need to create youtility. Jay defines youtility in his book as marketing that is so useful, people would want to pay for it.</p> <p>Jay shares the story of Hilton Hotels' program called Hilton Suggests on Twitter and how the program came about.</p> <p>You'll hear a great example of how they helped a guy on Twitter who was looking for a vet in the area. They helped him when he needed it most, and this will probably lead to him booking a Hilton hotel in the future.</p> <p>Jay says the difference between helping and selling is just two letters, but in modern business those two letters make all the difference.</p> <p>At a recent conference, Jay heard Gary Vaynerchuk say, "Everybody wants to be a hunter, but nobody wants to be a farmer." Youtility is about long-term play. If you sell something, you make a customer today. But if you help someone, you can create a customer for life. You need to start to think about marketing, customer acquisition, loyalty and retention over a longer time horizon.</p> <p>You'll hear why Jay wishes that more businesses were less self-serving and more useful.</p> <p>Listen to the show to hear how Columbia Sportswear uses indirect marketing and provides youtility to their customers.</p> Are you wondering how your business can be more useful? Do you provide youtility?

He also hosts The Mobile Mixed Podcast. Greg advises big brands on mobile marketing, including AT&T, Electronic Arts, Cabelas and Sony Pictures.</p> <p>Greg shares what businesses should do to make their mobile experience more user-friendly.</p> <p>You'll learn about the best tools available to build your own mobile site and how to discover the kind of devices people are using to visit your site.</p> <p>Share your feedback, read the show notes and get the links mentioned in this episode below!<br /> Listen Now<br /> You can also subscribe via iTunes, RSS, Stitcher or Blackberry.</p> <p>Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show:<br /> Mobilizing Your Website<br /> Why it's important for businesses to think about the unique needs of mobile users</p> <p>Greg shares why you have to think where your customer or audience is coming from. The way we consume content today—whether it be email, social, using search or listening to podcasts—is mainly through a mobile device.</p> <p>The first entry point to you, your business or brand is more likely to be a mobile phone. You want the customers' experience to be very friendly and optimized to whatever device they are on. Around 53% of the US population has a smartphone.</p> <p>You'll discover why Greg believes email is overlooked when it comes to mobile.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why Greg believes mobile email is an opportunity for marketers.</p> <p>How to find out if mobile users are coming to your website</p> <p>Greg recommends that the first thing you should do is look at analysis software such as Google Analytics. It will show you how many people in your current audience are coming to your site from a mobile device. It will also break out the numbers by specific device.</p> <p>You'll probably discover that 20-50% of the overall visits to your site are coming from a mobile device.</p> <p>Secondly, depending on your email service provider, some will offer insights into how many of the email opens are coming from mobile. You'll find out why this is a good indicator if you're a big emailer.</p> <p>Greg shares how you can look to see from a social perspective if people engage with you from a mobile device on Twitter or Facebook.</p> <p>You'll hear how many people visited Social Media Examiner over the last 30 days via a mobile device.</p> <p>Listen to the show to find out why MillerCoors launched Android-specific solutions for their audience.</p> <p>Why we need to think differently about tablet users versus mobile phone users</p> <p>There's a lot of misconception about how people use their smartphones. Greg recently read a study where 68% of smartphone usage is from home. Mobile doesn't necessarily mean on the go.</p> <p>You have to look at your own customers and brand and see where they are interacting with you to help determine how much it's going to affect you.</p> <p>Greg believes with the tablet experience, you will start to see more usage in the evening hours. People use them as a second screen experience while sitting on the couch in front of the TV.</p> <p>Google Analytics helps you see the time of day people are hitting your site with their specific devices. You might then correlate that to the likelihood of people sitting on the couch.</p> Is your website or blog mobile-ready? Are you wondering how to optimize it for mobile users?

It started to take over her life unlike any other social media platform.</p> <p>She had the entrepreneurial spirit, but in the medical world, the opportunities are very limited.</p> <p>In February 2012, Cynthia launched her blog Oh So Pinteresting.
