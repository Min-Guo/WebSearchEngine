[crossed out logo for Autism Speaks] Support one built by autistic people, for autistic people. [logos for the Autistic Self Advocacy Network and the Autism Women’s Network] Reblogging to spread the word, cause evidence shows that Autism $peaks are classic horror movie villains. Reblogging because I’ve always wondered who to support instead of AS. To every friend of mine who reblogs this, thank you. It means I can trust you. <3 Thanks for making me aware of these organizations.  (via lauretteob) Source: autisticbeekeeper.wordpress.com 2 weeks ago 43638 notes DJ Set Before Weezer at Warsaw, March 30th bigdatabigdata: Brooklyn!

Jesus fuck the worst thing I’ve ever seen in life?? You’re the one who summarizes recent Simpsons episodes I’m sure you’ve seen worse. This has the added horror of being a huge-budget live-action thing featuring a LOT of actors all complicit in this scene. They are all there, doing it. There is no animation to hide behind. I feel shame for everyone. What…is this… Oooooh myyyy god what in the FUCK I…. What Source: oddbagel 1 month ago 23770 notes geekatheartily: geekatheartily: Alright my dear hearts. As I am inundated with extra games from my penchant for Humble Bundles, I have decided to give one (or more) away each month for the rest of the year, and perhaps beyond. For the month of March, I am giving away a Steam code for Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition. What to do, between March 1st and March 15th. ♥ Reblog this! Must be following me (geekatheartily). Must have a Steam account. On March 16th, 2016 I will announce the winner of Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition. To redeem your prize, you must be willing to supply your name and email to the Humble Bundle website (They will only send you emails if you want them). Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor! 1 week left to enter to win a Steam code for Tomb Raider! Source: geekatheartily 1 month ago 9 notes macleod: VOTER FRAUD? Precincts in Michigan Primary posting signs saying “Must Have Valid ID” – this is NOT TRUE! In the state of Michigan you DO NOT need your ID to vote! Share this quickly!
