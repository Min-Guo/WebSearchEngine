Raelyn Cole served ASLO as Managing Editor of L&O from 1965 to 1996, spanning the editorships of Francis A. (Dick) Richards, Yvette H. Edmondson, and Peter A. Jumars. She stayed on for much of the term of David Kirchman, overseeing the closing of the Seattle office of L&O. Lyn was recognized with the Tommy and Yvette Edmondson Distinguished Service Award as she finished her long and productive career with ASLO.
