The New MQA Online Services Portal Is Here The Florida Department of Health’s Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) has launched a new and improved online services portal to better meet the needs of over one million licensed health care professionals and applicants in Florida. The new user-driven layout provides access to many updated features. With the improved capabilities of the new portal, licensees will experience increased functionality to manage and maintain their licenses with a personal user account.
