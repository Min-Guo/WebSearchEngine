Florida Board of Physical Therapy Search Posts, Pages & FAQs: FAQs Contact Sitemap Friday, April 15th, 2016 Home Licensing Renewals Resources Meetings The Board New Legislation Impacting Your Profession Posted in Latest News on March 24, 2016. During the 2016 Legislative Session, SB 450 passed, which affects several components within the physical therapy profession and became effective March 23, 2016. Not knowing the requirements or grounds for discipline within your profession does not alleviate you from accountability of practicing your profession responsibly. Therefore, please read the information below carefully as it pertains to your physical therapy license. With the implementation of SB 450, physical therapists may now provide treatment to a patient for up to 30 days for a condition not previously assessed by a practitioner of record, or a physician licensed in another state. The previous maximum was 21 days. If the treatment extends beyond 30 days, a practitioner of record must review and sign the treatment plan unless the patient has been examined by a physician licensed in another state and the patient has been diagnosed as having a condition for which physical therapy is required and the physical therapist is treating that condition. The bill also authorizes any person who holds a physical therapy license and a degree of Doctor of Physical Therapy, to use the letters “D.P.T.” and “P.T.” However, a physical therapist may not use the title “doctor” without also clearly informing the public of his or her profession as a physical therapist. It is unlawful for a person to use the letters “D.P.T.” unless the person has a physical therapy license as well as a doctoral degree in physical therapy.
