This Solar Calculator will compute the size and estimated cost to install a solar energy system for your home or building. The solar calculator's financial analysis is based on energy bill savings you can expect and the net solar system cost, after tax credits and other incentives are applied. The solar calculator results are based on many assumptions and the limited data you will enter. An actual site assessment by a trained professional contractor will be needed to determine the actual costs and benefits of installing a solar energy system.
