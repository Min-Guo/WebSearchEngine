In this refreshingly entertaining how-to guide, bestselling author and world-traveling success coach, Jen Sincero, serves up 27 bitesized chapters full of hilariously inspiring stories, sage advice, easy exercises, and the occasional swear word, helping you to: Identify and change the self-sabotaging beliefs and behaviors that stop you from getting what you want, Create a life you totally love. And create it NOW, Make some damn money already. The kind you’ve never made before. By the end of You Are a Badass, you’ll understand why you are how you are, how to love what you can’t change, how to change what you don’t love, and how to use The Force to kick some serious ass. Advertising Editorial Reviews Publishers Weekly Sincero (Don't Sleep With Your Drummer) brings a fun, feminine verve to now well-tread self-help tropes, offering a promising new title in the genre that's not as completely irreverent as it sounds. The system Sincero outlines is a specific way of thinking about reality: imagining the not-yet-reality into the present. She includes important messages about forgiveness, personal power, gratitude, meditation, and learning from experience, alongside fear-banishing techniques. Original exercises, such as writing a letter to money, and ways to identify false beliefs abound with clever turns of phrase and chapter ti-tles like "Your Brain Is Your Bitch", "Present as a Pigeon", "Lead with Your Crotch", and "Doing vs. Spewing". Sincero writes with candor about her own struggles, heightening the message's accessibil-ity, particularly among a younger set. In essence: the vast, unknowable universe will give us every-thing we desire enough to envision, but laziness and doubt are banned. The tone is far more feisty than academic, and there's humor on every page, all of which is exactly what her intended audience most needs. (May) From the Publisher New York Times Bestseller “Sincero (Don't Sleep With Your Drummer) brings a fun, feminine verve to now well-tread self-help tropes The tone is far more feisty than academic, and there's humor on every page, all of which is exactly what her intended audience most needs" Publishers Weekly online “If touchy-feely self-help tomes make you feel, shall we say, less than inspired, this no-nonsense manifesto to awesomeness might be just what you're looking for. Filled with blunt and sassy advice, do-it-yourself exercises in personal transformation, and a whole lot of hilarity, You Are a Badass will silence your inner critic, and help you build a life worthy of the kind of Facebook news feed that others envy. Take a day off from looking for your inner goddess, and spending some time cultivating your outer badass instead.” Bustle.com “I adore Jen's realistic and funny take on all matters of living an awesome life. She has such a gift for writing in a very digestible way that will appeal to everyone. If you're looking for purple unicorns and rainbows you won't find them here, what you will find are practical and easy ways to connect with your inner badass and change your life.” Madisyn Taylor, Co-Founder, DailyOM “Author and success coach Jen Sincero takes the self-help book to another level with her cutthroat humor and in-your-face attitude. The 27 thoughtful, well-written chapters are worth itby the time you finish the book, you will understand the secrets to a life you deserve and how awesome you really are at controlling the outcome of your life. In other words, you’ll realize how much of a BAMF you really are!” Albuquerque’s Weekly Alibi “Sincero has probably written the most entertaining self-help book many readers will ever get in their hands on. Reading this book was like talking to a best friend  the one that will tell you like it is no matter the circumstances and that forces you to think outside the box.” The State Hornet, California State University, Sacramento campus paper “[You Are a Badass] is (and I quote) “the self-help book for people who desperately want to improve their lives, but don’t want to get busted doing it.” You have permission to upsize your serving of awesome with this funny, fulfilling read. MindBodyGreen “YOU ARE A BADASS is a phenomenon!” Liesl Freudenstein, Boulder Book Store Read More Product Details ISBN-13: 9780762447695 Publisher: Running Press Book Publishers Publication date: 04/23/2013 Pages: 256 Sales rank: 64 Product dimensions: 5.20(w) x 8.20(h) x 0.90(d) Related Subjects Success, Motivation & Self-Esteem Videos   You Are a Badass Meet the Author Jen Sincero is a bestselling author and success coach who has helped countless people transform their personal and professional lives via her newsletters, seminars, private sessions, public appearances, articles, products, and books.

Anonymous 4 months ago Wonderful book written with humor and loaded with information. I wish that I had taken the time before turning 50 to read this book. Sometimes it takes awhile to figure out that you are a badass. Anonymous More than 1 year ago I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because it reinforces changes (mentally, physically, and spiritually) that I'm making in my life. This book has reinforced my belief that whatever I desire IS possible, available, and most importantly that I'm deserving of it. As Jen Sincero said in this book, "You are here to shine your big ass ball of fire into this world of ours." Jen does a great job of laying forth some steps you can take to (1) set aside tired excuses, and (2) get in sync with God/Source Energy/The Universe/The Force (or whatever you want to call it) so that we can realize and live the life that you want. The most critical aspect of making positive change in your life is to love yourself; without self-love you will not recognize your badassedness and you'll never be able to share your badass self in all of its glory with the world. Anonymous More than 1 year ago I enjoyed reading this book. It kept me interested!  Anonymous 8 days ago I LOVE this book. I think I've bought almost a dozen copies since reading it just to gift to people. I had so many "aha" moments while reading this book. Anonymous 24 days ago Amazing, funny, sassy and a great read! Definitely top favorites when it comes to this book. Usually I try to keep far away from such books seeing that some authors come across a little strong about improving people's lives, but Jen shares personal stories that make the reader laugh without losing the point of the that specific topic. She's like that girlfriend you can sit down with over a bottle of wine and just talk for hours and at the end makes you feel like you can move mountains and part seas. The person you want in your corner that when you fall back or fail at something just looks at you and says "So? Get back up, you still have a lot more in you!" and won't let you quit so easily. Love the casual tone of the book with pack full of information. If you're like me, and need someone to kick you in the rear once in a while, this book will help re-ignite that fire in you to keep going or start if you haven't already. Anonymous 4 months ago Loved this book. Anonymous 9 months ago Was recomended by some friends. Did enoy. Some great thoughts and helpcful tips and the authors personal stories were a riot. Great read. feather_lashes 9 months ago OMG, this book was so, so good. The message was exactly what I needed to hear. So much craziness is going on in my life right now and I find myself doubting my greatness every...single...day. The point Jen Sincero makes in this self-help book is we are all great, we all have enormous potential, we all possess the power to succeed at absolutely everything we direct our energy towards, but we are also our very own obstacle. Ms. Sincero identifies common thought processes and behaviors that keep us from living a truly awesome life and she coaches the reader on how to identify them, replace them, and move forward like a bad*ss. The first half of this book was absolutely perfect in my opinion - my favorite chapters were the ones about the power of gratitude. The later chapters got a little too new-age for my personal taste, with all the talk about the universe, vibrating energies, and controlling frequencies, but I could see where she was going with it. I benefited from this book and plan to implement some of the suggestions...I already have actually :). It really is great and I highly recommend it. Check it out! My favorite quote: “And while there are countless ways that we rip ourselves off, there’s one way in particular that is, without a doubt, the most rampant and the most devastating of all: we invest everything we’ve got in believing that we’re not good enough.” Anonymous 11 months ago Anonymous More than 1 year ago This is one of my favorite books! Anonymous More than 1 year ago Give this book as gifts. Helped me get to a new level of life.. Anonymous More than 1 year ago I've already recommended this book to a friend. Quite simply put it was direct, hilarious, and of course inspiring. Anonymous More than 1 year ago Anonymous More than 1 year ago Straight talk mixed with humor and inspired mini-epiphanies (for me). It's like my best friend helping me regain perspective - only better. I highly recommend. Anonymous More than 1 year ago mrsmamamac More than 1 year ago I love this book.  You can read it over and over.  This is much lighter read than some of the other great books out there like Success Principles.  I encourage everyone to read this.  I am buying copies for all my gratuates! Anonymous More than 1 year ago Anonymous More than 1 year ago So much of this book feels like common sense and yet I bought my copy after borrowing this book from the library. I know that I will quote parts of it to my (young adult) children and close friends. I also plan to use it as a reference for when I'm feeling off track and needing inspiration or advice. Anonymous More than 1 year ago I really benefitted from reading this book. As someone who has struggled with self-doubt and indecisiveness, I found much here to help me move in better directions. I bought a copy for my elder son.
