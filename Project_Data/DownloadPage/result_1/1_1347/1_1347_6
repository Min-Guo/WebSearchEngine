Do the things that they're saying.'" by Jon Adams 4h ago This week’s RuPaul’s Drag Race was one of the most intense yet: The main challenge was inspired by The Wizard of Oz and saw the queens turning out original outfits inspired by the iconic book, both for themselves and the cast of Little Women L.A.. Did we mention they had to choreograph an interpretive dance? No biggie, right? Naomi Smalls and Kim Chi took us over the rainbow, but Robbie Turner and Derrick Barry had the house dropped on them. Following a lip-sync to Icona Pop’s “I Love It,” it was Robbie who had to click his heels three times and go home. In this week’s installment of “Whatcha Packin’,” Michelle Visage sat down with the Seattle queen to talk about her experiences on the show. “You know, I was waiting for someone to ask me how my head was,” Robbie joked “I’ve never been out of control of my drag before. I was not cooperating in my own head even though I was saying ’Go for it. Do the things that they’re saying.'”     That’s not uncommon, assured Michelle. “To the kids that are watching this: When you do audition or you do get on the show, some really talented kids get in their own way and don’t know why. Then they get off the show and say, ’I don’t even know who that was.'” of course, Michelle had a great deal of nice things to say about this queen, too. “You’re just such a great spirit, and so much fun. You surround yourself with the right people because you seem like such a happy person.” The two also discussed Robbie’s favorite challenge, a special look she never got to wear on the show and her lipstick message. “I told them they were all trash, for sure.” RuPaul’s Drag Race airs Mondays at 10/9c on Logo.
