Communications Intern at Lasell College: Adios, Lasell!
#Content#
skip to main | skip to sidebar Communications Intern at Lasell College Read about the life of a Communications Intern at Lasell. Thursday, May 5, 2011 Adios, Lasell! There have been a lot of last-timers at Lasell for me this week: My last class, last time modeling in the student fashion show, last homework assignment, and now today is my last day of my internship. I remember when I started, wondering how on earth I was going to juggle it all-but it seems as if time figured everything out for me. Deadlines came and went, I presented material or I goofed something up, or I missed a day here and there to do something for myself. I've had many great experiences here-helping to set up for a dedication, writing an article about it, attending a fashion show to write about, but even the day-to-day was fun. While it seems so long ago I was interviewing on-campus faculty and staff for different assignments, or chasing someone down for Michelle, nothing prepared me for coming in this morning to find a cute little bag with a sweet card, GORGEOUS scarf (which I put on right away) and a mug which felt was SO me: "She packed up her potential and all she had learned, grabbed a cute pair of shoes and headed out to change a few things." Few quotes fit me better than this! Overall it's been a FANTASTIC semester here, and I couldn't be more ready to take everything I've learned and hit the real world ground running, ready to give my all! Michelle & Diane, thank you all for everything you've taught me. Thank you for every opportunity, every piece of advice, and every ounce of support you've given me throughout this short semester.
