Jason Aldean About Jason Aldean Two-time ACM “Male Vocalist Of The Year” Jason Aldean released his sixth studio album Old Boots, New Dirt on October 7, 2014. The release’s smoking lead single “Burnin’ It Down” earned PLATINUM certification in only 9 weeks, making it the fastest selling single of 2014. Aldean has sold over ten million albums and has taken 13 trips to #1 on the Country Radio charts. Each of Aldean’s albums has been certified PLATINUM with his last album NIGHT TRAIN earning PLATINUM certification only four weeks from its release. Aldean was recently recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) as the Top Digital Male Country Artist In History with sales totaling over 21 million downloads. He is currently headlining his monumental BURN IT DOWN TOUR, which saw him play five stadium dates in addition to sold-out shows in the country’s biggest amphitheaters and arenas. Aldean sold out each of the shows on his previous NIGHT TRAIN TOUR �� often in minutes the day they went on sale. He has broken over 40 venue attendance records, and the tour has gone on to sell an unparalleled 1.9 million tickets - most recently launching his 2014 BURN IT DOWN TOUR.
