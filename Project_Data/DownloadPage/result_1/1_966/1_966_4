Small Steps to Living Healthy is an email-based program that allows Floridians to sign up for weekly tips and tricks delivered directly to their inbox. These are ideas to help you reach or maintain your healthiest weight. Each week of the month highlights a designated topic area: Set Goals. At the beginning of each month, a challenge and health tip will be emailed. Examples of challenges include replacing sugar-sweetened beverages with water or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Move More. During the second week of the month, physical activity will be the highlighted. Participants will be introduced to different styles of exercise and the benefits of each, including options for persons with disabilities. Be in the Know. Week three “fun fact” emails will provide facts on other aspects of healthy living related to healthy weight such as stress, depression and time use. Eat Smart. The focus of this week’s email will be nutrition. Florida fruits and vegetables of the month, as well as recipes, will be offered through the Living Healthy in Florida Campaign. Register for Small Steps to Living Healthy. You may opt out at any time. Healthiest Weight Florida is a public-private collaboration bringing together state agencies, not for profit organizations, businesses, and entire communities to help Florida's children and adults make choices about healthy eating and active living.
