Im still trying to decide what career path I want to go to but this is a possibility and I want to know everything before going in blind. The thing I found most difficult was actually getting there, which was the same problem I had in high school. Before you’re able to take clients, or on days you don’t have any, the work can get a bit monotonous. That was honestly what I found hardest; the written tests were easy for me, floor tests were fine, clients were fun (for the most part), and I loved my classmates. Waking up knowing I had a sheet of boxes due by the end of the month filled with many of the same processes to be completed? Eh. Of course, practice makes perfect, yadda yadda. If only some things could have been taught in different ways, I think I would have found it more beneficial (not to mention, graduate on time, oops). With that said, a little monotony here or there is a small price to pay when the overall outcome is something you really want. There are many, many things I absolutely adored about cosmetology school that totally outweigh the bad or difficult, including the people I met and opportunities I was given. I would do it all again in a heartbeat! Good luck with your decision! Remember to make it for YOU and no one else! :) 59 ♥ / 16 September, 2014 2040 ♥ / 13 September, 2014 I love doing bridal makeup so, so, so, so much. <3 84 ♥ / 6 September, 2014 idunim-e003-deactivated20160117 asked: do you know of a good eyeliner for stage makeup? I'm a guy in theater and I have no idea what to get because my stage makeup kit didn't come w/ eyeliner but I need some for my high school's fall show; can you suggest some? Of course! For a pencil liner, I love Urban Decay 24/7 Glide On Pencils and Milani Liquid Eye. For gel/cream, Lorac Pro Cream Liner and Maybelline Eye Studio Gel Liner. For liquid, Urban Decay 24/7 Waterproof Liquid Liner or Milani Eye Tech Extreme. Good luck at your show! :) 75 ♥ / 1 September, 2014 Good luck to everyone going back to school this week! You’ll do great! 155 ♥ / 1 September, 2014 Any favorite looks from the VMAs tonight? 49 ♥ / 24 August, 2014 1 2 3 4 5 Older →
