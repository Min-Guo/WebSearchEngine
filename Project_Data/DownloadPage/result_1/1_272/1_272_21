Girl Gone Wild I am a writer, dancer, and scientist living and working in the Pacific Northwest. This is the jumping off place for my blog and website. Visit me: http://www.rubymcconnell.com/ http://www.rubygonewild.com/ Ask Archive Random RSS Search 14th Apr 2016 | 132 notes guardian: Land of the lost —  Homeless in California’s redwoods Toni Lynn Evans, 54, has pale skin, bright blue eyes, and is missing a front tooth that was knocked out by her ex-husband.  She became homeless in 2012 after her mother died and the home they shared was foreclosed. One day, she found herself standing in her driveway surrounded by all her belongings. Much of it was stolen — computer, stereo, a box containing her mother’s ashes. Evans is one of some 240 homeless people who have built a “land of the lost,” a semi-permanent community tucked away among the redwoods in northern California.  They may be far from San Francisco’s own tent cities, but face similar problems – including rats, trash and what to do with human waste.

Some days, the rains win and I find my outdoors inside. I love to sink into a good natural history museum like Alice falling down the rabbit hole, sliding through hisotry one strange species at a time. There are giant, saber-toothed salmon, mastedon, oddly shaped beaver, and more birds than I though possible all arranged neatly in their places in time and space. A good natural hisotry… View On WordPress 4th Apr 2016 Sun-kissed. (at Puget Sound, WA) 3rd Apr 2016 Seattle.
