I can't find flaws with 2.0, or really any of Big Data's songs. They've all been wonderful, and maybe it's just my own taste. Even the unreleased Bombs over Brooklyn and Stroke of Return were wonderful. Joshua Rumley Awesome Discovery I stumbled across Big Data on Spotify one afternoon and I have been bumping his music ever since. 2.0 is almost a perfect album and one I can listen to from start to finish. This album has me grooving. Lily Gomez The Glow (feat.Kimbra) , Dangerous (feat.Joywave), Big Dater, Automatic (feat. Jenn Wasner), and Perfect Holiday are the best songs ever!
