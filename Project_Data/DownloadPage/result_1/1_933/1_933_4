Texts from Star Trek: The Next Generation

Texts from Star Trek: The Next Generation Engaging in debauchery since Stardate 41153.7. About Character Directory Episode Directory Texts Only ask me anything rss archive Texts from TNG is now dormant. The rewind series has ended, and submissions are officially closed. If you’ve just arrived, check out the best of Texts from TNG here. If you’re a fan of Voyager, Voyager Week can be found here. I want to thank you all for making Texts from TNG such an incredible journey. I know that probably sounds silly - I run a blog, not a starship - but it’s true. I know I’ve said this hundreds of times already, but I truly do appreciate all the likes, reblogs, messages, and follows all of you have given me.  The success of Texts from TNG has given me confidence that I have never had before. I’ve always loved making others laugh, but usually get mixed results. (My stand-up career started and ended at age 5. I guess my grandparents’ anniversary party wasn’t the best venue. But I digress.) Knowing that the Internet isn’t nice to the unfunny, I took a gamble starting Texts from TNG. I was waiting for the first comment to come through saying “these are stupid,” but it never came. Then came the reblogs. And the nice messages. Then Wil Wheaton gave his stamp of approval. Then Texts from TNG started gaining press. I initially thought that 200 followers would be the absolute best I would do. Now I have over 25,000. I literally make thousands of people laugh every day. And If I can do that, what can’t I do? Keep in mind that I said this blog is dormant, not dead. There’s a chance I could be back with more comics, but for now, making this blog dormant was the best decision. Besides, you know what they say about all good things…they eventually get made into movies ;) Until then, Leah :: Texts from TNG **ETA: Several people have messaged me asking about blogging tips, my future endeavors, and why exactly Texts from TNG is going dormant. I’ll be posting my responses to these questions on my personal blog. And to everyone else who sent me a lovely message, thank you, and I’ll be responding to you soon! :) 1 year ago 680 notes #this has been a message from Leah #personal blog: leahlikes Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 5574 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 2314 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 1024 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 1552 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 1589 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 1338 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 1099 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 1627 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Source: textsfromtng 1 year ago 863 notes #Texts from TNG Rewind Next page Page 1 / 67
