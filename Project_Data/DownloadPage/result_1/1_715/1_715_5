Some of the biggest comic book artists and illustrators often make fanart. Anonymous A juliedillon: euclase: You’re talking about two different kinds of fan art, hero. 1. Dude-approved work-safe cis-het mainstream fan art. Quality and coolness guaranteed. 80s and 90s nostalgia optional. Passes muster at comic book conventions when scrutinized by chinbeards. Sometimes called “mashup” or “remix” or “here’s my minimalist Dune movie poster.” Your bro friends won’t make fun of you for it. Your pals and buds and platonic besties will ask where they can get the t-shirt. Artists sometimes make this kind of fan art “just for fun” when they’re “in between other projects.” Usually sold at places like Threadless and Gallery1988. 2. Actual fan art. Featuring the unapologetic and unironic female and queer gaze. Here’s a quick folder I threw together of some of my fave actual fan art. This this this. When dudes make fan art, they can get jobs and book deals and t-shirt printings and  gallery shows from said fan art, they are respected for their creativity and “reimagining” and “mashups.” When women make fan art, it’s written off as frivolous and embarrassing and a waste of time and talent, something that gross silly fangirls do that potentially ruins shows for dudes (note: unless they make dude-approved “non-embarrassing” fan art.) (Gee, I wonder who the self-appointed  tastemakers and gatekeepers are here.) It’s bullshit.  Here’s the question though: if I make fan art of something I genuinely and passionately care about and enjoy, but that “dude bros” and mainstream also happen to like, is it 1 or 2?

It may just be me, I don’t know. But every single time I see this on my dash or on someone’s blog or anywhere else, I kind of just breathe a sigh of relief. That’s one more person who cares. That’s one more person who doesn’t hate me. Because it means so much, especially when all the media is spewing out is that I’m a terrible person and no one wants people like me near them. It means so much because I’m tired of people who won’t sit next to me in class, or who choose to join the longer line at the grocery store because they don’t want to be beside me and my family. It means so much when I have to lift my head any time someone says the words Islam or Muslim because I’m scared that they’ll say something that’ll hurt, when I have to pay attention to the news because who knows what so and so is saying now, who knows which of my people are being attacked now, who knows what’s going to happen to me now. It means so much because I’ve been given the idea that the world is against me. And a huge part of it may be, but at least I’ve been reminded that some of it, just a small group of people, acknowledges that I’m a person too. That people like me are just that, people. Maybe it’s just me, I don’t know. But now you do, so thank you for believing that I’m human when so many people don’t. #justiceForMuslims (via machturtl) March 31, 2016 • 909 notes • kaypablewriter Overwatch Community: Haha wow those SJWs get soooo offended wow Blizzard: So anyway we are going to remove this one pose with someone showing their ass for no reason -- Community: THIS IS WHERE WE DRAW THE LINE BOYS, START A PETITION AND A BOYCOTT, THIS IS THE BATTLE OF OUR TIME March 31, 2016 • 156,435 notes lindsayribar: lapizzalazulii: interstellarvagabond: cybuggin: cybuggin: Tonight at the con I was about to take a picture with a deadpool cosplayer and when we were posing he said “is it okay if I put my hand on your waist?” And I was like “yeah sure thanks for asking!” And he just laughed and said “I’m deadpool, not CREEPpool!” And that was the most wonderful and reassuring con experience I’ve ever had. HERE HE IS BTW I love that so many Deadpool cosplayers ask for permission for all of their affections and pranks. In my experience the majority of Deadpools are good people. I hope you guys don’t mind if I add mine! This guy was super cool! We were going to take the picture and he goes. “Would it be okay if I picked you up?” and of course I’m like “UH- YEAH!!” So really!!! Asking consent is NOT THAT HARD and really appreciated!! People at cons! Be like these guys! Woo!
