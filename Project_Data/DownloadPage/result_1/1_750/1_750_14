15th Brain Connectivity Workshop – Marseille 2016
#Content#
Menu Welcome Practical information Program Registration Sponsors Contact close× Welcome General summary Brain Connectivity Workshop (BCW) is a well-established workshop series, which has been held annually in Europe, USA, Australia and Asia for the last 14 years. The 15th edition of the BCW will be held in Marseille, France, on June 22th-24th, 2016. BCW is a satellite of the annual meeting of OHBM (and Marseille and Geneva, hosting respectively BCW and OHBM in 2016 are well connected). BCW attracts every year a public of 100-150 participants working in cognitive, computational and clinical neurosciences. The discussions are centered on all themes around brain connectivity including structural and functional imaging, modeling, brain function and clinics. BCW is highly influential in the field due to the traditionally high quality of speakers and a long track record of innovation. For instance, both, the Connectome and The Virtual Brain have risen from the BCW community. The typical BCW format —a first educational day of lectures held by international authorities in their fields, followed by two days of short talks with ample time for discussion provides a unique forum for creativity, controversy and brainstorming. BCW 2016, introduced by a first day of tutorials by experts in their field, will feature focused sessions on themes such as perturbing the brain, mapping the brain, and the dynamic brain in function (cognition) and dysfunction (epilepsy). See here the program (coming soon). Organizing committee The previous conference chairs have elected Viktor Jirsa as the Scientific Organizer of the Brain Connectivity Workshop 2016. Viktor Jirsa is the Director of the Systems Neuroscience Institute (INS, Aix-Marseille University, UMR 1106 INSERM). He will be assisted by the local scientific committee including: Demian Battaglia (INS, CNRS); Christian Bénar (INS, CNRS); Mireille Bonnard (INS, CNRS); Andrea Brovelli (INT, CNRS); Monique Esclapez (INS, INSERM) and Maxime Guye (CEMEREM, CNRS) and the BCW scientific board member Ingo Bojak (University of Reading, UK). © 2016 Atout Organisation Science
