Figure 12 Learn about Rulemaking What is Rulemaking? "Rulemaking" is defined as the adoption, amendment or repeal of a rule. In its simplest form, rulemaking consists of drafting the rule text, providing notice to the public, accepting public comment and filing the rule for adoption. However, rulemaking can become more complicated, involving many more steps. What is a Rule? According to Chapter 120, Florida Statutes, Administrative Procedure Act (A.P.A.): Rule means each agency statement of general applicability that implements, interprets, or prescribes law or policy or describes the procedure or practice requirements of an agency and includes any form which imposes any requirement or solicits any information not specifically required by statute or by an existing rule. The term also includes the amendment or repeal of a rule. What is the Florida Administrative Code? The online Florida Administrative Code (FAC) is the official compilation of administrative rules for the state of Florida. The Department of State oversees the publishing of the FAC and updates it weekly. What is the Florida Administrative Register? Florida Administrative Register (FAR) is the title of a daily publication which gives the public current information about the status of rules moving through the rulemaking process including proposed rules; emergency rules; and notices of change, corrections and withdrawals. The Register also includes notices of agency public meetings, workshops and hearings, and miscellaneous actions required to be published by statute. Below is a list of notices required to be published in the FAR: Notices of Rule Development Notices of Proposed Rules Notices of Change, Correction and Withdrawal Emergency Rules Petitions and Dispositions Regarding Rule Variance and Waiver Notices of Meetings, Workshops and Public Hearings Notices of Petitions and Dispositions Regarding Declaratory Statements Notices of Petitions and Dispositions Regarding Non-rule Policy Changes Announcements and Objection Reports of the Joint Administrative Procedures Committee Notices Regarding Bids, Proposals and Purchasing Notices of Intent to Adopt rules pursuant to Sections 120.54(6), 120.54(1)(i)2., and 403.8055, Florida Statute Notices of Invalidation of a Proposed or Effective Rule How do I subscribe to the Florida Administrative Register? Electronic Version: Current and past issues of the FAR are available for viewing online here at: https://www.flrules.org/Default.asp. Users of the e-rulemaking website may subscribe, free of charge, to receive e-mail notification of notices submitted by agencies at: https://www.flrules.org/subscriber/signup.asp. What Laws and Rules Govern Rulemaking? Chapter 120, Florida Statutes, Administrative Procedure Act (A.P.A.), sets forth the rulemaking procedures that agencies must follow. The Department of State, through its legislatively-delegated rulemaking authority, has adopted Chapter 1-1, Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.), to interpret, implement and make specific the requirements of Chapter 120, Florida Statutes. What authority does an agency need to adopt a rule? A grant of rulemaking authority and a specific law to be implemented are required before an agency may draft a new rule, amend a current rule, or repeal an existing rule (reference). Furthermore, an agency may adopt only rules that implement or interpret the specific powers and duties granted by the enabling statute. No agency shall have authority to adopt a rule only because it is reasonably related to the purpose of the enabling legislation and is not arbitrary and capricious or is within the agency's class of powers and duties, nor shall an agency have the authority to implement statutory provisions setting forth general legislative intent or policy. What is Reference Material? When a rule makes reference to a form, document, or related item, it must be "incorporated by reference" into the rule. Reference materials may refer to specific ordinances, standards, specifications, maps, graphs, charts, reports or similar materials generally available to affected persons and published by either a governmental agency or a generally recognized professional organization. Any forms, including instructions, which solicit information or impose requirements not already required by statute or existing rule and which are used by an agency in its dealings with the public shall be incorporated by reference in the rule if it meets the definition of a "rule."
