Johnson + 0 1 0 Reply   Hey, Your supposed to Heed the snakes Warning 'n go away.    I know as I lived with Rattle Snakes greeting me 'n my 'lil Doxie every morning & evening for many years, I shot plenty of 'em as they tried to "Jump 'n Strike" me! If they did not pop-up from under anything, they were left alone. I was then living in          "The Swamp Tent" at the 4077 M*A*S*H in So. Cal.  I have lotsa pictures of them. Once, as I walked up the mountain side, my right boot froze up in mid air, cause I looked at him, he looked at me, I let him alone as he did me, 'n off he rattled, goin' up hill, we did choose different trails that time!
