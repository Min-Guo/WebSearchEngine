What Is Watershed Science? Watershed Science is a field that specializes in the treatment and production of clean water for daily use in people's homes. What does a Watershed Science Technician do? Watershed Science Technicians treat and manage wastewater to provide clean water supplies to people. They often work with complex machinery, plant technologies, and strong chemicals to achieve this end. They are also responsible for monitoring the plant's operating systems and assuring that everything is running smoothly. Watershed Science Technicians must be detail-oriented and possess sharp math and technological skills because of the equipment they work with every day. Memorization skills also come in handy, as Watershed Science Technicians must be familiar with standard operating procedures and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. Where Does a Watershed Science Technician Work? Watershed Science Technicians usually work in water treatment plants, a highly industrial environment that is often noisy and sometimes smelly. Many Watershed Science Technicians are required to work both indoors and outdoors, meaning they are sometimes exposed to unpleasant weather conditions and potentially dangerous situations. It is important to note that Watershed Science Technicians experience more occupational injuries than the average career. Most Watershed Science Technicians are employed by their local governments, though some people work for private utility companies. Because all water treatment plants must always be operating, Watershed Science Technicians are likely to work day shift and be on call for nights and weekends. Sometimes Watershed Science Technicians must work overtime or on holidays. What Is the Average Watershed Science Technician's Salary? The average salary for a Watershed Science Technician stays around $42,760. The lowest salaries hover around $24,850, while the top salary stars around $67,810. To advance in field and increase salary amount, further certification is required. See the education section for more details.
