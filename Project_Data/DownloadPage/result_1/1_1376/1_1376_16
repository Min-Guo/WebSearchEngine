These rankings are a snapshot of the health of counties across the country and they emphasize that health is not a singular effort but a combined work in progress across all community partners.

These rankings use data related to physical environments, social and economic factors, health behaviors and clinical care. In Broward County, the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) is designed to address specific opportunities for improved health that have been identified by the community.
