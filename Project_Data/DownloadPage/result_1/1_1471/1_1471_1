Score big and purchase your Atlanta Hawks tickets on the official NBA Resale Marketplace! During the team's early years they were shuffled around the Midwest quite a bit, first as the Tri-Cities Blackhawks based out of Moline, Illinois, then simply "the Hawks" out of Milwaukee before becoming the St. Louis Hawks out of their new Missouri home. Once settled in St. Louis with a crop of new young players, the NBA team went from being nominal to becoming one of the most feared basketball contenders in the league. After relocating several times over the following decades, the team eventually nested in Atlanta in 1968 to emerge as the Atlanta Hawks. Since then, the Hawks have turned out several notable players including Dominique Wilkins, Moses Malone and Bob Pettit. While they may not hold traditional rivalries like many other teams in the NBA, a brewing contention with the Orlando Magic continues to simmer. Head over to Philips Arena to cheer the Atlanta Hawks on to victory! The entire family will catch a great game on the hardwood when you purchase your Atlanta Hawks tickets now!
