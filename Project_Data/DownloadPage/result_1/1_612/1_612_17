Weekly Ad Credit Cards Gift Cards Gift Ideas Order Status Store Finder Toggle navigation About Careers Investors  Community Relations Sustainability  Government Affairs ENERGY STAR® Honors Best Buy Again, and Here’s Why By Natalie Albers Staff Writer March 29, 2016 Best Buy Blue Shirt Jose Florentino is an expert at finding ways to help our customers use new appliances to save money and energy. He is one of the many reasons why this week we were named an ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year for the third time and earned the distinction of Sustained Excellence by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). An appliance expert at our Millenia Mall store in Orlando, Fla., Jose is a problem solver. When customers come in to look at products, he quizzes them about what they need and want. It’s not just about size and color, he will tell them. It’s about features. For example, some washing machines will spin out most of the water from the clothes before they’re moved to the dryer. High-efficiency dryers, can do a load in less time with technology like moisture sensors that stop the machine when the load is dry. These options are often found in ENERGY STAR certified products. Jose will also help customers determine if they can save even more money through utility company rebates from buying qualified products. Over the past seven years, we have trained more than 100,000 Blue Shirts on the benefits of ENERGY STAR certified products, which are independently verified to save energy without sacrificing features or functionality. We make those products easy to find in our stores and on BestBuy.com. The number of ENERGY STAR certified products that we’ve sold since 2009 will, over the product lifetime, help our customers save $616 million on their utility bills while preventing 8.7 billion pounds of CO2 emissions. That’s the equivalent of removing more than 789,000 cars from the road for a year. This mix of customer education, employee training and product offerings is why the EPA awarded us with this honor. To talk with a knowledgeable Blue Shirt like Jose, visit a Best Buy store, or learn more about our appliance selection online.
