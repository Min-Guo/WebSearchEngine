" ↑ VIEW FULL SITE Read WWWWTXT Browse Images About the Project Contact the Editor I am an official Nice Guy and I am also a True Nerd. ☯92JUN I’m thinking about my dream of the VR Internet again. ☯93APR There are simply too many unknowns in 1994; call back in 2014 and ask again. ☯94NOV It’s a real shame that almost everyone has to start dying to learn what it means to be alive. ☯94NOV VR could be the drug of the next century. ☯94AUG Low-cost home virtual reality is closer than most people realize. All over the world, people are working on its development. ☯92OCT The most positive effect of the net is that it lets people with different world views get together and learn from each other. ☯93OCT The most negative effect of the net is that it lets people with a flawed world view get together and reinforce their own beliefs. ☯93OCT Why are adults seen as sensible in their use of technology? Children don’t design nukes, fight wars, or generally act like idiots. ☯94AUG I don’t call myself a cyberpunk or a techno junkie. I call myself Jimbo. ☯94APR I don’t know what all the fuss is about. I like New Coke. ☯85JUN computer haters / data travelers / electro-wizards / paranoid androids / stupid users / techno-freaks / unix gurus / warez dudes ☯93JUL Out of the room today, I saw a DEADHEAD sticker on a UNIVAC. ☯85AUG I hope to eventually pull MTV out of the dark analog eighties and make it ftp-able, telnet-able, and email-able. ☯93AUG Maybe the Net will be the place to eventually start a cyber-MTV with digital video and a massive “video-server”? ☯93AUG Meta Archive RSS Social Networks Facebook Twitter Flickr danielrehn.com
