In front. On the Agent&#8217;s left side.</p> <p>What most people don&#8217;t know is there is set of principles and standards surrounding the way an Agent handles their badge. For instance, according to tradition, an Agent is required to carry their badge at all times. And Agents &#8220;may not use your badge to obtain free donuts more than once a month.&#8221;* The badge is a symbol of being a member of an elite band of technology warriors and Agents, as a group, take them very seriously.</p> <p>One of the rules is an Agent should never leave their badge unattended. If a member of the Agent fraternity comes upon an unattended badge, they will confiscate it and retain it until they can return it to its rightful owner culturally-awesome and somewhat embarrassing way.</p> <p>The Icarus I project is an out-growth of just such an effort.</p> <p>In the fall of 2012 an Agent at our corporate headquarters &#8211; who shall remain nameless- made the mistake of leaving his badge, number 13337, unattended in his workspace. One of his colleagues, noticing this oversight, grabbed the badge. And kicked off an effort that created the project featured here. </p> <p>On December 1st 2012, Geek Squad entered the space race by successfully sending that confiscated badge to near-space. After spending a month to design and build the capsule period, a team of Agents launched Icarus I on that cold December day. The capsule, with the Agent’s badge, achieved an altitude of nearly 90,000 feet and traveled 165 miles. The flight lasted approximately two hours and forty minutes, after which the capsule returned safely to Earth and was recovered by the ground crew.</p> <p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/nhVdUCOt-fs" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe><br /> &#160;</p> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>The Build</h2> <p>The Icarus I capsule employed a modified Styrofoam bait cooler for the primary payload container. A custom-constructed aluminum mounting arm was used to secure the payload (a Geek Squad badge) to the exterior of the capsule and mount internal capsule components. Inside the capsule were two GoPro Hero cameras secured to the aluminum mount, one facing directly down toward Earth and the second facing outward toward the badge. </p> <p>In addition, Icarus I contained a SPOT satellite GPS tracking unit, two custom-built electronics charging assemblies, a battery pack, hand warming packs, and miscellaneous air and newspaper packing materials to protect the components. The capsule lid was secured using zip ties. A 1200g Kaymont weather balloon was attached 5 feet above a 3 foot parachute from which the payload was suspended by an additional 15 feet of rope. The balloon was inflated using 94.85 cubic feet of industrial grade Helium. With a total payload weight of 1294 grams, the vehicle achieved an ascent rate of approximately 900 ft/minute.</p> <h2>Materials</h2> <table style="" width="500"> <tbody> <tr> <td width="40" align="left"><strong>Qty</strong></td> <td align="left"><strong>Description</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">1</td> <td colspan="1">Styrofoam bait cooler</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">NA</td> <td colspan="1">Badge gantry materials,&#160;miscellaneous&#160;hardware and rope</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/GoPro+-+HERO3+HD+Camcorder+-+White/6571752.p?id=1218757819828&amp;skuId=6571752" title="GoPro Hero HD Cameras" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">GoPro Hero cameras</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/GoPro+-+HERO3+Replacement+Housing/6571852.p?id=1218757819349&amp;skuId=6571852&amp;st=6571852&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1" title="GoPro Skeleton Housing" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">GoPro skeleton housing</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">2</td> <td colspan="1"><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/GoPro+-+Tripod+Mount+-+Black/1007629.p?id=1218249514540&amp;skuId=1007629&amp;st=gopro%20tripod&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1" title="GoPro Tripod Mounts" target="_parent" class="track_outgoing_link">GoPro tripod mounts</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/SanDisk+-+Ultra+32GB+Secure+Digital+High+Capacity+(SDHC)+UHS-I+Class+10+Memory+Card/4957218.p?id=1218582250917&amp;skuId=4957218&amp;st=32gb%20sdhc&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=2" title="32gb SDHC memory card" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">32GB SDHC memory card</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td>1</td> <td><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/SPOT+-+2+Satellite+GPS+Messenger+-+Orange/1231175.p?id=1218239168854&amp;skuId=1231175&amp;st=spot%20tracker&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=2" title="SPOT locator" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">SPOT locator</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">2</td> <td colspan="1"><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Energizer+-+Advanced+Lithium+AA+Batteries+(4-Pack)/9064709.p?id=1218020986191&amp;skuId=9064709&amp;st=%20Energizer%20AA%20Advanced%20Lithium&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1" title="4-pack Energizer AA Advanced Lithium" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">4-pack Energizer AA Advanced Lithium batteries</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">2</td> <td colspan="1">LT1302 (Mintyboost based) charging circuits</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">2</td> <td colspan="1"><a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Dynex%26%23153%3B+-+3%26%2339%3B+Mini-B+USB+Cable/3182249.p?id=1218382959120&amp;skuId=3182249&amp;st=3182249&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=1" title="Mini USB cables for GoPro charging" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">Mini USB cables for GoPro charging</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">1</td> <td colspan="1"><a href="http://kaymontballoons.com/Near_Space_Photography.html" target="blank" class="track_outgoing_link">1200g weather balloon (Kaymont, 3cm opening)</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">1</td> <td colspan="1"><a href="http://www.the-rocketman.com/recovery.html" title="3ft parachute" target="_blank" class="track_outgoing_link">3ft parachute</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">1</td> <td colspan="1">Helium tank, K cylinder (217 scf)</td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="1">1</td> <td colspan="1">Helium custom regulator + connections</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&#160;</p> <h2>Project Design</h2> <p>Sending an unmanned aerial balloon with a treasured payload to near-space involves intense planning, exact engineering and a little luck.

As the centerpiece of our home theater systems, our TVs can go from pulling in our favorite news show in the morning to streaming that YouTube video Mom just sent to us over lunch, then playing the latest Mad Max movie during evening &#8220;wind-down&#8221; time. And anytime we are not using the TV&#8217;s screen, it serves as our connection to the music libraries available through the ever-growing list of streaming services. That is one busy machine.</p> <p>Naturally, all these pictures and sound don&#8217;t fall out of the sky. (Yes Mom, I know that&#8217;s the way it used to work.) Most of us have any number of set-top boxes, gaming consoles and audio receivers connected to our TVs. Most of those devices are connected to the &#8220;display&#8221; (that&#8217;s home-theater-installer language for &#8220;TV&#8221;) using HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) cables. Because the modern TV is much smarter than the old tube TV, they handle a lot more data and, therefore, need complex cables to bring the data to the device. <p>Since HDMI cables are a little more complicated than the old coax cables, long cable runs can be a problem. I recently got together with our Agent University video production team to shed a little light on how HDMI cables work and how to make sure they work properly in your home theater setup.</p> <p><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bvtWJrti7TI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p> <p>I hope this helped.

Yet many households fail to realize their expanding collection of hardware – growing to an average of nearly eight connected devices each this year – strain home networks, producing sluggish connections and a real need to free their speed.</em></p> <p>The good news is that setting up home network to support all your connected devices is simpler than you thought. Here’s how to free your speed.</p> <h3>Start with your high-speed Internet connection</h3> <p>Not all broadband connections are the same, especially when you’ve got a family of avid gamers or lovers of streaming movies. You’ll want to ensure that the Internet coming into your house is fast enough to support what you’re looking to do.</p> <p>To start, you’ll want to see how fast your existing connection is. You can do this by visiting <a href="/do-it-yourself/tools/test-your-broadband-speed.aspx" title="Speed Test">our Geek Squad Internet speed test page</a>. This tool measures your connection in Mbps (Megabits per second). </p> <p>How fast should your incoming connection be? For basic streaming video, we recommend at least 3 Mbps or higher. For HD quality video, 5 to 10 Mbps is recommended. You’ll want to compare what you’re actually getting to what your Internet package provides and contact your Internet service provider if you need to upgrade.</p> <p>Now that you have your Internet sorted out, it’s time to consider what router works best to free your speed.</p> <h3>Newer routers are more powerful routers</h3> <p>If you have an older router, it may not be able to handle the number of connected devices you’ve added and all the new streaming music, movies and games you’ve started using. Now may be a good time to upgrade. When you’re looking at new routers, you’ll want to consider several features to free your speed.</p> <p>You’ll come across an alphabet’s worth of letters describing wireless networks. You may have heard of “Wireless G” and may be wondering what the “N” and “AC” you’re seeing on boxes means.</p> <p>Those letters describe what wireless standards the router supports (for example 802.11n or 802.11g). For a long time, Wireless G was the standard for most routers, but this has been largely replaced by the faster, more capable Wireless N. For the latest and greatest, though, you’ll be looking for Wireless AC.</p> <p>A new router will support more than one standard, usually whatever it’s rated for and the older ones. A Wireless AC router, for example, will support AC, N, and G. That’s important because not all of your connected devices will support the latest standards. A Wireless AC router, however, gets you the most compatibility for all devices, and best performance for Wireless AC compatible devices.</p> <p>The wireless portion of your network isn’t the only part of the router that affects speed. Inside every router is a processor or CPU that acts like a traffic cop, processing incoming and outgoing data through the network firewall and then transmitting to and from your computers. </p> <p>The faster the processor, the less time that information spends inside your router and the faster your overall network speeds. Newer routers (and higher end routers) have powerful processors that sort data packets quickly and efficiently.</p> <p>A router that supports the latest wireless standard and has a good processor will easily handle all your existing devices as well as any new connected tech you bring home in the future.</p> <h3>Keep your wireless router up to date</h3> <p>Modern routers use firmware in the same way that your computer uses an operating system like Windows. Most current routers will be set to check for updated firmware automatically.</p> <p>Firmware updates may improve how well your devices connect to the network and the router’s overall performance. These updates can also correct security flaws as they’re discovered. You’ll want to log into your router’s administration page occasionally to ensure the firmware is up to date.</p> <h3>Keep your devices up to date as well</h3> <p>Computers and connected devices use software to control their network hardware. Computer operating systems like Windows or Mac OS X will check for software updates automatically, but if you do run into issues with your network, make sure to check for updated network drivers from the computer’s maker as well. This is especially important after an operating system update, including Windows 10.</p> <p>Tablets and other connected devices may have updated firmware to improve network performance and security, so it’s important that you’re checking for the latest updates there as well.</p> <h3>If your devices support it, connect to your 5GHz network</h3> <p>Most new routers are “dual-band” in that they support both 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio bands. The older 2.4GHz band is like a crowded highway, as you not only have your neighbor’s router running on it (important in an apartment building), but also older cordless phones, wireless mice and keyboards, Bluetooth, etc. In some cases, even Microwaves and faulty lamps can put out 2.4GHz “radio noise.”</p> <p>When switching a device to the 5GHz network, there are fewer devices and more “channels” to choose from, meaning your device can transmit and receive without as many interruptions. There is one downside &#8211; 5GHz signals don’t have the range of a 2.4GHz signal. </p> <p>This isn’t a problem for most homes, but if you have a larger house, there are options to overcome this such as wireless repeaters that work with your existing router.</p> <p>With amount of wireless traffic generated in the average US household growing by leaps and bounds, your Internet experience can be limited by just how much “attention” your wireless router can share between devices. Applying these network tips we’ve shared will help provide you with my bandwidth to support your always-on, totally-connected family.</p> <p><em>Agent Derek Meister has been a member of Best Buy’s Geek Squad for over ten years, helping clients reduce their techno-stress in-store, in-home and remotely as part of the Geek Squad Online Support team.

Their metrics show businesses received a little less than half the spam they usually receive over a month. Perhaps the spammers are taking vacation days as well?</em></p> <p>Of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean users can take time off from being careful with their email. While email-based malicious software and phishing scams are down, there were still over 57.6 million new malware variants created in June, a significant rise from April and May. So, although you may be getting fewer bad emails, those emails are more likely to have a new virus that will try to get around your computer&#8217;s security software. We&#8217;re also seeing an increase in the number of ransomware attacks last month. Ransomware is malicious software that will attack your system, encrypt your important data and documents, and then ask you to pay a ransom to get the decryption tool to get your data back. It&#8217;s nasty and it&#8217;s on the rise.</p> <p>Here are six tips for keeping your data safe:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Use proactive software protection.</strong><br /> Anti-malware software is a basic requirement for initial protection on all computers.</li> <li><strong>Make sure you are backing up your data on a regular basis. </strong><br /> Viruses and spyware can creep into your computer and easily degrade performance and corrupt or even destroy data.</li> <li><strong>Use a firewall. </strong><br />A firewall places either software or hardware between your computer and the wider Internet. Your home wireless router will have firewall software in place to protect your computer from a random stranger connecting directly to it. Make sure your router&#8217;s security settings are setup correctly. </li> <li><strong>Be cautious of suspicious emails from unknown sources. </strong><br />Don’t open emails with attachments if you don’t know the sender. Even when you know the sender, be wary if you didn&#8217;t expect the attachment.</li> <li><strong>Steer clear of websites of ill repute.</strong><br /> These are havens for malicious and annoying intruders like spyware. Remember, &#8220;there ain&#8217;t no such thing as a free lunch&#8221;.</li> <li><strong>Keep your operating system updated. </strong><br /> Repair the security holes that hackers love to exploit with the newest critical updates from Microsoft or Apple. For Windows 7 and 8.1 users, keep in mind that Windows 10 will be launching towards the end of this month.</li> </ul> <p>So remember, one of the reasons spam works to spread viruses and spyware is that it looks so innocent. To avoid the hassles that come with an infected machine, treat every email with care and always be suspicious of messages from senders you do not recognize.</p> <p>Visit <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/do-it-yourself/">http://geeksquad.com/diy</a> for more &#8220;Do It Yourself&#8221; tips on using your technology.</p> <p><em>Agent Derek has been removing techno-stress from the lives of his Geek Squad clients since 2005.

The upgrade will be available free to users who have Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or Windows 8.1 installed on their machines. Microsoft is encouraging Windows users who are going to take advantage of this free update to &#8220;reserve&#8221; their copy of the system before the release date to ensure a smooth transition.</em></p> <p>Although some copies of Windows 10 will be available for purchase, most of the work done to distribute the software will be done online. In order to prepare the way for this release, Microsoft sent out updates to both the Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 operating systems that will make it easier for you to successfully download the new software. Those updates contain something called the &#8220;Get Windows 10&#8221; app, which is why you started seeing the Windows logo icon in your task bar a couple weeks ago. Your task bar with the Get Windows 10 app looks like this: <br /><img src="http://www.geeksquad.com/intelligence/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/win10-icon.png" alt="task bar with Windows icon circled"> </p> <p>We recommend clients reserve a copy of Windows 10 ahead of time to make sure they get the update as soon as possible. It appears Microsoft is using the reservation model so they can trigger downloads from their side rather than withstanding the onslaught of traffic at their servers from users trying to download the software when it first becomes available. Traditionally, early-adopters tend to overwhelm servers when an important or popular product first becomes available. Late nights trying to download the latest version of Grand Theft Auto has shown me the advantage of letting the download be triggered when the source can actually complete the activity.</p> <p>Windows 10 will have a new, expanded Start menu (similar to the one that was part of the pre-Windows 8 system), a more effective way of allowing users to work on more than one application at a time, a new browser, and will feature Cortana, Microsoft’s personal digital assistant. For more on what’s new in the new system, go to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/features">Windows 10 page on the Microsoft website</a>.</p> <p>The people leading the rollout say that it could take a couple of weeks before the download becomes available to every person who reserved a copy. People with newer computers should be able to complete the download process in twenty minutes or so. If your machine is an older model, downloading and installing Windows 10 could take more than an hour. Be sure you leave yourself enough time so you can handle the blips in the download or restart the process if necessary.</p> <p>And, as always, we strongly recommend you back up the data on your computer before you update your operating system. For advice on the best way to get this done, visit the <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/do-it-yourself/tech-tip/tips-for-backing-up-your-data.aspx">“Tips for Backing Up Your Data”</a> page on our website.</p> <p>On the Windows 10 release date, July 29, we will be posting some additional information on installing and optimizing the new system on our website.

They say they will help you out and eliminate the viruses if you will provide your credit card information.</i></p> <p>An increasing number of computer users are receiving similar phone calls and some — afraid of potential data loss and device damage — are surrendering their bank account information in the hope this will protect their tech.</p> <p>If you get such a call, we recommend only one response — hang up. It’s a scam!</p> <p>Our clients continue to report phone scams targeting both PC and Mac owners. Cybercriminals pretending to work for Microsoft, Geek Squad, or another other nationally-recognized tech company call their intended victims, claim they’ve scanned the potential victim’s computers remotely and found viruses on them. Taking advantage of the average computer user’s fear of viruses, they trick people into giving them remote access to the computer.</p> <p>Once the scammer has access to the victim’s system, they will often show the user scary-looking error messages on the machine as “proof” their machine is infected. They will then say the only solution is for the user to make an immediate payment to the “technician” so he can clean up the “dangerously infected” computer. Often, they will the offer to install more “protection” software onto the system to prevent this from happening again. Unfortunately, this is most often the scammer using access to the victim’s machine to install other bits of malware to capture the victim’s online shopping or banking information.</p> <p>If your first instinct is not to trust <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling" target="_blank">cold calls</a> about fixing your computer, you’re absolutely right. Scammers use publicly available information (like your name and telephone number) to make initial contact and can often make an educated guess about your PC’s operating system. They can sound very convincing (they are good at this), but don’t be taken in.</p> <p>It’s important to understand that reputable tech companies (like Microsoft, Geek Squad and other tech leaders) <strong>will not scan computers remotely without permission from the owner</strong>. They will not call computer users unless they are already working with them on a support issue initiated by the user.</p> <p><strong>Should you get one of these telephone calls, here are a few tips to help protect yourself:</strong></p> <ul> <li>When in doubt, hang up and call the company back at their publicly listed telephone number. You can usually find contact information on their web site. (Geek Squad’s number is 1-800-433-5778)</li> <li>Never provide a credit card or banking account information to someone on a cold call, even if they claim to be from a computer support company.</li> <li>Never give remote access to your computer to any technician unless they can confirm they are a legitimate member of a computer support company with which you have an existing support agreement.</li> </ul> <p><strong>If you’ve been a victimized by a phone scammer:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Contact your credit card or bank and speak with the fraud prevention team to have the charges reversed and the account protected from future charges.</li> <li>Change your computer password, along with the password of any online accounts that may have been provided to the cybercriminal. Before changing the password, you might want to read the article on our website about <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/do-it-yourself/tech-tip/keys-to-a-secure-password.aspx">creating a secure password</a>. </li> <li>Update your security software and run a full scan on your computer, or use one of our tools to scan your machine. You may also want to contact one of our <a href="http://www.geeksquad.com/chat-with-an-agent/">Geek Squad Online Support Agents</a> to have the PC checked for malware.</li> <li>Report the scam <a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/" target="_blank">to the FTC</a> to help alert other potential victims.</li> </ul> <p>Phone scams are successful because cybercriminals rely on computer users trusting an unknown person with access to their computers. Together, we can defeat these scams by simply hanging up when you receive an unrequested support call, regardless of who they say they are.</p> <p><i>Agent Derek has been removing techno-stress from the lives of his Geek Squad clients since 2005.

Agent Derek has been a regular contributor to the blog, using his Geek Squad experience, electronic repair prowess and near-obsessive interest in all things tech to help the rest of us keep our equipment up-to-date and in good working order. Recently Derek had a conversation with the folks at Best Buy Public Relations about what it has beem like to be a Geek Squad Agent. Which led him to put his reflections in words. Here are those words.</em></p> <p>I recently celebrated my 10th anniversary as a Geek Squad Agent. </p> <p>It seems almost a lifetime of tech changes have occurred in that time.</p> <p>Consider: </p> <ul> <li>The day I was hired, April 23, 2005, was the same day the first video was uploaded to a new website called YouTube.</li> <li>Apple OS X 10.4 Tiger would be released six days later.</li> <li>Windows XP was 4 years old, and Windows Vista was still two years away.</li> <li>Most tech blogs in 2005 were talking about whether the desktop market was dead, to be taken over by laptops. By 2008, it had happened.</li> <li>Desktop computers still came with heavy CRT monitors (I had a 21” Viewsonic monitor weighing 58 pounds).</li> <li>Most computers came with 256 MB to 512MB of memory, and 60GB to 250GB of hard drive space. These days, standard computer memory is measured in gigabytes and storage in terabytes. </li> </ul> <p>I started out as an in-store Counter Intelligence Agent at the local Best Buy. By the end of the year, I was cruising the neighborhoods in my Geekmobile, providing on-site assistance as a Double Agent.</p> <p>After five years in the field, I moved into the virtual world of online support, helping clients with their technology as a Covert Agent Dispatcher, Fulfillment, Partnership and Quality Assurance Agent.</p> <p>The focus of our work changed almost as quickly as the technology. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_parent">Moore’s Law</a>, which turned 50 this year, is an oft-quoted observation about transistors that highlights the exponential rate of growth and improvement in technological infrastructure. As an Agent, Moore&#8217;s law has always been exciting because it means more than just cheaper processors, more computer memory or smaller camera sensors. It anticipates the new and unexpected ways this increased capacity can be used.</p> <p>Geek Squad Agents have progressed from fixing primarilty heavy desktop computers, to working on laptops and notebooks, tiny netbooks, smartphones, tablets and TVs. Today, I&#8217;m just as likely to help a client with a question about getting their smart watch to talk to their connected thermostat as I am to help them clean up temp files on their laptop.</p> <p>Along my journey I&#8217;ve faced plenty of challenges in my roles, but also an amazing number of opportunities to stretch my skills. In addition to providing remote assistance to clients, I have been a media spokesperson for the company, helped provide support for our clients through social media and been a member of our Agent of Justice team.</p> <p>Three things have consistently helped me over these 10 years: curiosity about how technology works, passion for talking technology with our clients and pride in the culture behind this 20-year-old organization of Agents known as Geek Squad.</p> <p>To the next 10 &#8230;</p> <p><em>Agent Derek has been removing techno-stress from the lives of his Geek Squad clients since 2005.

Yes, even Agents have to stand up from the keyboard and go to get some sun every so often. And, for me, one of the best ways to play outside is to ride my bike. I’m so inspired this spring that I will be participating in the National Bike Challenge, a program that encourages everyone to track their biking miles over the summer as a way to encourage the use of their two-wheelers.</em></p> <p>The Challenge runs from May 1 through September 30. Participants register on the <a href="https://nationalbikechallenge.org/" target="_blank">National Bike Challenge website</a>, where they log in to record their bike rides and are awarded points for every day they ride and every mile they pedal. Everyone who registers and participates qualifies for the monthly prize drawing. Then, at the end of the challenge, participants who finished at the top of their category will qualify for additional prizes.</p> <p>While you can manually track and enter your daily or weekly rides, I’m an Agent so I dug around looking for a tech approach that would make all this easier. The solutions I found not only make it easier to submit your miles, but also provide you with a wealth of other activity information you can use to pursue your health and wellness goals.</p> <p>If you have a smartphone, you already have the basic hardware needed to track your ride. Several apps are available on the Android, iOS and Windows platforms to help track rides. Four apps in particular have the ability to directly sync your riding activity to the National Bike Challenge website once you setup your account: <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank">Strava</a>, <a href="https://www.endomondo.com/" target="_blank">Endomondo</a>, <a href="http://www.mapmyride.com/" target="_blank">MapMyRide</a> and <a href="https://www.moves-app.com/" target="_blank">Moves</a>.</p> <p>Most of these apps will have both free and paid versions. For new riders, the free service will use your phone’s GPS to track your ride and give you helpful information such as the total distance traveled, average speed, elapsed time and even calories consumed. Syncing with the National Bike Challenge site is included.</p> <p>Paid subscriptions to those apps usually include more in-depth information for advanced riders looking to improve their rides, including segment information and the ability to record heart rate information from Bluetooth monitors like the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/polar-h7-bluetooth-smart-heart-rate-sensor-black/6735489.p?id=1218789789406&amp;skuId=6735489" target="_blank">Polar H7</a>.</p> <p>If you are looking for more information than what is available on your smartphone, there are bicycle-specific devices available. Cycling GPS units attach to a bicycle with sensors that can track speed, distance and cadence, making the data available through an easy-to-read display on your handlebars. Units like <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/magellan-cyclo-315-3-gps-cycling-computer-with-built-in-bluetooth-white-black/9867209.p?id=1219443102299&amp;skuId=9867209" target="_blank">the Magellan Cyclo 315</a> or <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-edge-touring-gps-enabled-cycling-monitor-white/8619093.p?id=1219357518925&amp;skuId=8619093" target="_blank">Garmin Edge Touring</a> use GPS to not only track your ride, but also provide directions on pre-loaded routes. Some models include the ability to pair with a Bluetooth or ANT+ heart rate monitor.</p> <p>GPS watches, like the <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/tomtom-multi-sport-gps-watch-with-heart-rate-monitor-dark-gray/9919992.p?id=1219043690335&amp;skuI" target="_blank">TomTom MultiSport with Heart Rate Monitor</a> or <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/garmin-vvoactive-smartwatch-for-apple-ios-and-android-smartphones-black/3363093.p?id=1219579640800&amp;skuId=3363093" target="_self">Garmin Vivoactive</a> can be used across a number of sports. Their small form factor makes them a great choice for those who run as well as ride.</p> <p>Another great feature of any of the services used to sync to the National Bike Challenge site is their ability to share your progress with others. Most have their own community aspects, allowing you to follow (and challenge) friends, as well as share your progress with your favorite social media sites like Twitter or Facebook. Even within the National Bike Challenge site, you can create both local and national teams for schools, organizations or work. (Even <a href="https://nationalbikechallenge.org/workplace/7249" target="_blank">Best Buy has a team</a>).</p> <p>However you track your ride, the end goal is to get out and be more active. <a href="https://nationalbikechallenge.org/rider/62024" target="_blank">I’ll be out there</a> with you and my fellow Geek Squad Agents adding our miles to the totals. Good luck and be safe out there. Don’t forget your helmet.</p> <p><em>Agent Derek has been removing techno-stress from the lives of his Geek Squad clients since 2005.
