Dolly singing live for us mere mortals would be enough news, but the Queen of Country has also confirmed on Twitter that she will be duetting with “California Gurl,” Katy Perry. I’ll be collaborating with the ever amazing and oh so talented @katyperry at this years @ACMAwards! #COMC @CBSTweet https://t.co/e67OOZ62W8 — Dolly Parton (@DollyParton) March 21, 2016 After Dolly’s kaleidoscope of butterflies finished typing up her tweet, Perry quickly responded with multiple prayer emojis expressing her gratitude on being able to share a song with the Backwoods Barbie. MY PRAYERS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED I shall remember though that I am but one sequin on this living legend's costume! https://t.co/4XY42M3ked — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) March 21, 2016 Parton is attending the ACM Awards to accept the Tex Ritter Award for her autobiographical television movie, Coat of Many Colors, which aired last year on NBC. Country isn’t Perry’s usual genre of music, but she did a pretty good cover of Dolly’s “Here You Come Again” with Kacey Musgraves, so there’s hope. [ video unavailable on this device ] The ACM Awards will air April 3 on CBS. h/t: Attitude Christopher Rudolph Pop culture and entertainment enthusiast. I know too much about the Oscars and Oprah. @chrisreindeer Tags: Katy Perry, Dolly Parton View related posts around the web Powered By Zergnet ZergNet NewNowNext about archive FOLLOW LOGOTV LOGO LINKS About Logo Contact Us Channel Locator Events & Sweepstakes Press Advertising Info Privacy Policy NEW [Updated 2/9/2016] Terms of Use NEW [Updated 2/9/2016] Closed Captioning Copyright Compliance Ad Choices © 2016 Viacom International Inc.
