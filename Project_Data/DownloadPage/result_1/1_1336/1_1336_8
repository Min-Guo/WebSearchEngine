Florida Board of Speech-Language Pathology & Audiology Search Posts, Pages & FAQs: FAQs Contact Sitemap Friday, April 15th, 2016 Home Licensing Renewals Resources Meetings The Board CE/CME Quick Report Feature on CE Broker Posted in Latest News on February 23, 2016. The Florida Department of Health, Division of Medical Quality Assurance (MQA) verifies your continuing education/continuing medical education (CE/CME) records in the electronic tracking system powered by CE Broker prior to your license renewal. The Department encourages you to log in to the tracking system before applying for renewal to ensure your information is complete and accurate. Although most CE/CME providers report CE/CME classes to CE Broker immediately, they legally have 30 days to report. Verifying timely reporting by CE/CME providers shortly after course completion is your key to a seamless renewal experience. If the approved-CE/CME provider does not report your hours into the tracking system, you will need to self-report your hours. Keep in mind that only Florida-approved providers are required by law to report your hours. MQA is committed to making your reporting experience quick and easy. In an effort to expedite the reporting process, an instructional video and pocket card were developed to inform health care practitioners about the Quick Report feature. Using the Quick Report feature will allow you to report all of your CE/CME hours completed with the same approved organization at one time. To learn more about the Quick Report feature, please view the video and pocket card below.
