Application (PDF)Change Profession Requirements Process Fees Statutes & Rules A physician in training may only practice medicine under a fully licensed DO or MD in an approved training program, such as an internship, residency or fellowship. A physician in training may prescribe legend and controlled substance medication under certain conditions. This registration does not give the registrant the privilege of working outside the training program – NO MOONLIGHTING. This registration must be renewed annually. General Licensure Requirements: Graduation from an osteopathic medical school approved by the American Osteopathic Association (AOA). Acceptance into an internship, residency, or fellowship training program which leads to subspecialty board certification in this state, or acceptance into an internship, residency or fellowship training program in a teaching hospital in this state. File a completed application and pay all required fees. Refer to application instructions for a list of specific documents and information needed. Section 456.013(1)(a), Florida Statutes, provides that a licensure application and fee are valid for one year.  Application fees are non-refundable. The licensing process involves the collection of credentials from the applicant and other sources, such as hospitals, medical schools, other states, etc. Once documents are received, an application specialist will review them; however, it may be necessary for the application specialist to request additional information or clarification regarding a particular document. Our goal is to review materials as quickly as possible, but we must be thorough. We process applications, mail, e-mails, and telephone calls in date order. Staff will mail you a deficiency letter approximately two weeks after receiving your application, so please refrain from contacting our office until after you have received your initial deficiency letter. We will also work closely with the program coordinator at the hospital/program in which you will be training. We also recommend that you work closely with that individual to ensure your registration application is approved prior to your program start date. Some applicants may have to appear before the Board at one of their regularly scheduled meetings before a license can be issued. Reasons for an appearance include previous disciplinary action in another state, malpractice, criminal history, health history and other application deficiencies. Having one of these issues is not an automatic appearance as each application is reviewed on a case by case basis.  You will be notified in writing if your appearance will be required. Initial Registration Fee: $100.00 Florida Statutes You will be connected to the Florida Legislature website, which is the official custodian of the statutes.
