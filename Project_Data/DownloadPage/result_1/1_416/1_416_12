 Maps  Education Skip to content Home Learn Resources Learn Google's geo products give you and your students easy access to the world's visual information. Once, maps were available only to royalty but now, you can explore Earth, Moon, Mars, and even dive into the depths of the oceans. The possibilities of using Google Maps, Earth and Street View are as endless as your imagination. We encourage you to explore, create, and collaborate. Google Maps With Google Maps, you and your students can become arm-chair explorers and cartographers with ease. Google Maps are a fun and visual way to help students understand geography concepts, map reading, location, and distance measurement. Besides using Google Maps to teach the fundamentals of mapping, like latitude and longitude, you can inspire students to investigate the world and to think spatially. You can use Google Maps with your students to: Create collaborative maps Create a campus or school district map Create a family heritage map Get walking directions Plan a trip using public transportation Get biking directions Add or edit places on maps for your community Compare neighborhoods and communities across the world Understand traffic patterns Use maps as writing inspiration Google Earth Google Earth offers a variety of ways to interact with and explore the world, ocean, and beyond.
