Welcome to Bartleby.com Twenty Years of Great Books Online THE CONCLUDING line of Herman Melvilles classic American short story Bartleby, the Scrivener reads         Ah Bartleby, Ah Humanity! And so, Bartleby.comafter the humble character of its namesake scrivener, or copyistpublishes the classics of literature, nonfiction, and reference free of charge.    1   Bartleby.com began as a personal research experiment in 1993 and within one year published the first classic book on the Web (Whitmans Leaves of Grass). It was inconceivable then that a billion page views was possible, let alone, hundreds of millions of users.    2   I am proud to have shepherded our mission over the last two decades to serve both the academic community and the curious reader, especially continuing the development of our original offerings: quotations and poetry anthologies.    2   I welcome you as a patron, encourage your thorough use of our services, and look forward to your comments to benefit the quality and selection of our texts: bartlebycom@aol.com         Sincerely,         Steven H. van Leeuwen         Chairman & CEO         Bartleby.com, Inc.    4   Loading Shakespeare · Bible · Strunk · Anatomy · Nonfiction · Quotations · Reference · Fiction · Poetry © 19932015 Bartleby.com · [Top 150] · Subjects · Titles · Authors · World Lit.
