Our staff consists of licensed medical and environmental professionals, qualified support staff and interpreters, all dedicated to providing you with excellent service.  Additionally, we have a nurse on-call available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The Florida Department of Health in Indian River County has two main locations offering services to the community.  Our main site offers primary care services for adults, women's health, family planning, dental, WIC, chronic disease prevention program, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), epidemiology, immunizations for adults and international travel, We Care volunteer physician program, environmental health, and vital statistics (birth and death certificates). View the DOH-Indian River brochure for additional information on our services. Our Gifford Health Center Pediatrics clinic offers primary care services for children from birth through age 17 and also houses the Indian River County Human Services office.  Another role the health department fills is emergency response during times of emergencies or disasters, such as working in a Special Needs Shelter during a hurricane, where staff assist people who have special medical needs, or providing needed immunizations to populations at risk during events such as H1N1 (swine flu).  Quality Improvement at DOH-Indian River DOH-Indian River is part of an integrated agency under the direction of the Florida Department of Health State Office with local, county and state commitments.
