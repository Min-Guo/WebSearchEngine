This challenged me to think about the collection of poems in a new light and experience them from a truly sensorial place that reminded me how music, sound, and visual art are all connected.” 3 weeks ago - 22 “I think there’s a kind of fear that you feel to realize just how great she was"  (The Poetry Foundation) Sylvia Plath’s Ariel was published 50 years ago this spring.
