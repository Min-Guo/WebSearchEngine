We may do this based on information that ads partners share with us. We hope that this increases the usefulness of Twitter Ads for you. Here’s one way it would work. Let’s say a flower shop wants to advertise a Valentine’s Day special on Twitter. They’d prefer to show their ad to floral enthusiasts who subscribe to their newsletter. To get the special offer to those people, who are also on Twitter, the shop may share with us hashed emails from their mailing list. We can then match that to a hash of emails that our users have associated with their accounts in order to show them a Promoted Tweet for the Valentine’s Day deal on Twitter. Another way this works is when a person visits the flower shop’s website. In that case, the shop may share with us browser-related information (a browser cookie ID) that we can then match to an account that may receive the Valentine’s Day offer. It’s up to you If you do not want Twitter to match your account to information shared by ad partners to tailor ads for you, you can uncheck the box next to “Promoted content” in your account settings at any time: When you uncheck this box, Twitter will not match your account to information shared by ads partners to tailor ads for you. This means we would not match your account to information shared by ad partners, including browser-related information, mobile device identifiers, and email hashes, to tailor ads for you. This is the only place you’ll need to disable this feature on Twitter. Note: This privacy setting only applies to tailored ads. To learn more about your privacy options for other ads products, please see the following: Measuring brand impact and your privacy controls In addition, Twitter supports Do Not Track (DNT). When you have DNT enabled in your browser, Twitter does not match your account to browser-related information to tailor ads for you. Get more information on DNT, including how to enable it in your browser. On your mobile device, you may also have a “Limit Ad Tracking” setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (on Android). If you enable these settings, Twitter will not tailor ads for you by matching your device to app information from ad partners. You might also find these FAQ’s helpful. Was this article helpful?
