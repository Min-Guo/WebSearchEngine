This year, solar is expected to offset an estimated 20 million metric tons of harmful CO2 emissions, which is the equivalent of taking 4 million cars off U.S. highways, saving 2.1 billion gallons of gasoline or shuttering half a dozen coal-fired power plants -- and we're just scratching the surface of our capabilities.

Solar Energy Industries AssociationShared publicly  -  2014-09-30   IBM research and Airlight Energy unveiled a prototype last week of a #solar "sunflower" that can concentrate the sun’s radiation 2,000 times and generate 12 kilowatts of electrical power and 20 kilowatts of heat on a sunny day—enough to power several average homes. They hope to bring it to the market in 2017 at half to one-third of the cost of comparable solar converters today. http://seia.us/1ua9usa﻿Read moreShow less Solar Energy Industries Association's photos 47 27 4 comments Zeldro Haynes + 0 1 0 Reply   Nice﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

If the speed of the process could be increased dramatically then the level of detail attainable might be much better.  As it is they are having the same issue that occurs when using a gas or TIG welder vs a laser.  The heating of the solar glass melter (or gas or TIG welder) is slow enough that much of the heat migrates away from the point of interest, and causes melting (and other heat related issues) far from the heating point.  But all in all this is a great bit of hacking, must have taken many many human hours to get this to work.﻿ Read moreShow less Add a comment...

The project is two grid connected PV systems each of 500 KW. - The project will be located at the farm ( Abees farm) in Alexandria. Egypt - We will offer the land for the project for free but the project and the land will be returned to Us after the life of the system or the end of the contract - The project will sell the electricity to the National grid according to the FIT - The estimated area is about 10000 sq. Meters however we recommend 5 Feddan (21000 sq. meters) for project extension. - The daily production is estimated to 6000 KWh based on 6 hrs/day - The ROI will be in the range of 4 to 5 years. - the profits will be shared by you and Us based on the final agreement between the two parties - The specification of the system is all ready done, however we are open for any other design and specification. - the system would have the future of being Hybrid with any other \RE technology and also can be integrated with other agriculture production system. can finance By Export Bank USA,Also Insure Payment by them. the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM Bank).
