Here are some of the things you'll discover in this show: Social Customer Service Dan's story Dan, who has been in marketing or product development most of his career, says he has always been in a service business in some way. Dan talks about the impact of his first job out of school. He was a marketer at a direct-response company that sold high-end collectibles. One year around Christmas, he got a phone call that should have gone to customer service. A woman was upset because a gift she ordered for Christmas had not yet arrived. Dan shares how he made sure Christmas wasn't going to be ruined on his watch. Dan says taking an extra moment to think about something from the customer's point of view usually will make you a much better marketer. He talks about his roles at Discover and winning the JD Power Award for best customer experience, taking it away from AmEx. Listen to the show to hear how Dan got started in social media. How customer service fits into social media marketing Studies from Gartner say that as soon as next year, more than 85% of companies will have to compete on customer experience. It's getting too expensive for industries to compete on price, so they need to differentiate themselves by customer experience. Dan says when you interact with customers on a one-to-one basis on social media, it makes them more loyal. Loyal customers spend more with you, stay with you longer and tell their friends about you. All of these elements result in improved KPIs (key performance indicators), which is what marketers care about. Forrester's Customer Service Index is a pretty good indicator of how well large companies are doing, Dan explains. Over the course of many years, Forrester looked at the stock prices of the top- and bottom-performing public companies. The top-performing companies do well in customer experience, while the poor performers in customer experience are at the bottom. There’s a direct link between customer experience and profitability. Dan shares what happened at Discover when they looked at engagement rates on customer service responses (what happened after they responded to a customer and resolved his or her issue). Listen to the show to discover the biggest challenge of one-to-one marketing. Businesses doing customer service well On Dan's podcast they interview large brands such as Whole Foods, Jet Blue, Chipotle and Hertz, as well as lesser-known companies like Telstra. Telstra is the largest telecom company in Australia. Unlike most of the telecoms in the United States, they've decided to differentiate based on service.
