Box 929  Milton FL 32572-0929    Hours: Milton Location Monday–Wednesday 7:30 a.m.–4 p.m. Thursday 8 a.m.–7 p.m. Friday 7 a.m.–1 p.m. Midway Monday–Friday 7:30 a.m.–4 p.m. Jay 2nd and 4th Friday of the month 8 a.m.–noon What is WIC?  WIC is the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants and children. WIC provides supplemental, nutritious foods for low to moderate income pregnant, breastfeeding and postpartum women; and infants and children from birth to the age of five who are at nutritional risk. These foods are rich in protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins A and C. These are key nutrients commonly lacking in the diets of the WIC targeted population. Breastfeeding promotion and support are integral parts of the WIC program. Our agency has trained personnel who are ready to assist mothers in making informed decisions about infant feeding choice and in instructing them in the basics of breastfeeding. To participate in the WIC program you must meet the following criteria: You must be a resident of Florida or receive health care in Florida. Undocumented immigrants are eligible to apply as long as they reside in this state. You must be nutritionally at risk. The assessment of nutrition risk is made by a trained health professional, usually at the local WIC office at no cost to you. You must be income eligible. Your family's income must not exceed 185% of the U.S. Poverty Income Guidelines. If you are currently receiving Medicaid, Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA), or Food Stamps you automatically meet the income eligibility requirement regardless of actual gross income. Am I Eligible?  The WIC Prescreening Tool can be used to determine if you may be eligible for WIC benefits. This Prescreening Tool is not an application for WIC. To apply for WIC benefits, you must make an appointment at your WIC local agency. Check to see if you may be eligible for WIC benefits by using the WIC Prescreening Tool. For more information or to schedule an appointment, please call 850-983-5250.
