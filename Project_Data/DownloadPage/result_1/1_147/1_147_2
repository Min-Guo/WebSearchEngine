Google Play for Artists: Sell your original music
#Content#
ARTIST HUB Already have an artist hub account? Sign in   Reach more ears. Find more fans. Sell more music. Get started › * More info on International distribution Musicians: Get your music on Google Play Want to get your original music in front of millions of listeners? Then the Google Play artist hub is for you. Choose where your music is distributed, control whether it’s available for download or streaming, and suggest your retail prices. Reach your fans across the globe on Android, iOS, and the web. Your presence, your music, your choices. Google Play knows that no two artists are the same, and that musicians have different ideas for reaching fans. Some artists want to sell their music, while others want to release it freely into the world. Some have live recordings, others have studio tracks or new demos. If you are an independent artist who owns the rights to distribute your music, the artist hub lets you decide how to connect with fans on Google Play. Manage the image and bio on your artist page, upload your original WAV or FLAC files, and decide where and how to make your music available. Want to publish in every country where Google Play is available? Want to sell and suggest your prices? Want to make your music available to Google Play Music subscribers or for sharing? You decide, album-by-album or track-by-track. And you can change your suggestions and preferences at any time. (If you are signed to a record label or have an exclusive distribution deal, check with your record label or distributor to see which of your albums might be being delivered to Google already. Visit the Help Center if you have questions about this). Two ways to earn You have two ways to earn on Google Play. If you decide to sell your music, you suggest the retail price. Any time your music is sold on Google Play, you’ll earn your revenue share (up to 70%) based on your suggested retail price. And if Google Play includes your music in a pricing promotion, it won’t cost you anything - you will always earn at least the revenue share on your suggested price! Learn More. You can also opt-in to the Google Play Music subscription service. As fans listen to your music, your earnings increase. Learn More. One-time fee, unlimited albums. Google Music has a one-time $25 USD setup fee for each brand new store page. There are no fees for uploading tracks, creating albums, making changes to existing albums, editing your artist page, or anything else within the artist hub. Google Play keeps a 30% commission on any sales. Get started › Ready to get started? Set-up is quick and easy. All you need is a Google account. You’ll be ready to start selling and sharing your music in a matter of minutes. Please see our Google Play artist terms for additional details. Help Privacy Terms of Use Google
