Get started here. We want to show you ads that you find interesting and useful. This article provides an overview of how Twitter Ads work, why you see certain ads, your privacy settings and other options. About Twitter Ads You may see different kinds of ads on Twitter, such as: Promoted Tweets, Promoted Accounts, and Promoted Trends. We may show these ads to you when you are logged in or logged out of Twitter. They are clearly marked with a “promoted” icon. You can interact with promoted content in much the same way as organic content. If you follow, like, or Retweet content on Twitter, including promoted content, your followers may see your name associated with that content. Why you see certain Twitter Ads Your activity on Twitter, the information you provide to Twitter, and our relationships with ad partners all help make promoted content more relevant for you. When you use Twitter to follow, Tweet, search, view, or interact with Tweets or Twitter accounts, we may use these actions to tailor Twitter Ads for you. For example, if you search for a specific term, we may show you promoted content related to that topic. We also might tailor ads using other information about you, such as your profile information; your mobile device location (if location features are turned on); your IP address; or the apps installed on your device. This helps us show you local ads and other ads that you might prefer. Twitter may also tailor ads based on information that our ad partners provide us, like browser-related information (a browser cookie ID), a mobile device identifier, or a hashed email address. This helps Twitter display ads about things you’ve already shown interest in from brands and businesses that you may like. For example, if you’ve already visited the website of a flower shop, or signed up for their newsletter, you might see an ad on Twitter from that flower shop. We don’t share your private, personal information with advertisers to make this happen. Learn more. Managing your privacy settings We are committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. If you’d rather not see promoted content based on information that our ad partners provide us (like the browser cookie ID or email hash), there are several ways to turn off this feature: 1) Use your Twitter account settings to control whether Twitter will match your account to information shared by ad partners to tailor ads for you. To change your settings on twitter.com, visit the Security and privacy tab and adjust the setting “Tailor ads based on information shared by ad partners.” setting. To change your settings on Twitter for iOS, from the Me tab, tap the gear icon, select Settings, tap Privacy and content, then under the Privacy section, adjust the “Tailor ads based on info from ad partners” setting. To change your settings on Twitter for Android, tap the overflow icon select Settings, tap Privacy and content, tap “Tailor ads based on info from ad partners,” and adjust the setting on the resulting screen.2) Turn on the Do Not Track setting in your web browser so that Twitter does not match your account to browser-related information to tailor ads for you. 3) Enable the “Limit Ad Tracking” setting (on iOS devices) or the setting to “Opt out of Interest-Based Ads” (on Android), so that Twitter does not tailor ads for you by matching your device to app information from ad partners. 4) Each of these ad partners offers a way for users to opt out of their services. You can also visit aboutads.info/choices to learn more and opt out of all participating companies. You can also control how Twitter tailors promoted content when you are logged out. If you prefer your logged out experience not to include promoted content that is based on your logged-in Twitter activity, you can either enable the Do Not Track setting in your web browser or clear cookies from your browser when you log out of Twitter. In addition, whether you’re logged in or logged out, you always have the option to “dismiss” Promoted Tweets and Accounts that you’re not interested in seeing. This feedback helps us show you better promoted content.   Log in to Twitter Ads Tweet About Company Blog Help Status Jobs Terms Privacy Cookies Ads info Brand Advertise Businesses Developers © 2016 Twitter, Inc.
