The program establishes a set of benchmark requirements with respect to staffing and policies. Companies who qualify for accreditation will have to meet all the requirements set forth and pass a minimum of three (3) randomly selected inspections of completed installations. NABCEP Accredited Residential PV Installation Companies will provide consumers a way to find companies that are committed to: high quality installation standards; hiring fully trained and qualified staff; safe work practices; and customer accountability. Companies that receive the Accreditation will be primarily engaged in the installation of residential PV systems. Accreditation will be awarded to companies for each state or province they operate in. Companies that operate in multiple states or provinces will submit applications for each of those jurisdictions. Company Accreditation Handbook provides details about the program including: policies; requirements; application procedures; the Code of Ethics for NABCEP Accredited Companies; deficiency and appeals policies; and application and accreditation fees. To request an application for this program please email: companyaccreditation@nabcep.org. Include the words “application request” in the subject line.
