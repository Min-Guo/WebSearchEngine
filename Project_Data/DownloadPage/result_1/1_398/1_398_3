I am a teacher about religions and I previewed a number of videos on religion and history. They were so riddled with inaccuracies, stereotypes, biases and anachronisms that I was shocked, In one video, the narrator did not even pronounce the name of the religion correctly. There were similar problems in some sociology videos, which were so simplistic as to be misleading.\r\nStudy.com should get out of the humanities and social sciences. Their videos might make math or science more fun, but should not ever, ever be used to teach nuanced subjects about human beings, their beliefs and cultures. This customer had a NEGATIVE experience with this business. This customer WOULD NOT recommend the business to a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. by Tamar F. on Feb. 12, 2016 | Submit a Customer Review Comments Comment from the Business:Hi *****, I apologize that you had a negative experience on our website. We value our user's feedback, so thank you for sending us your thoughts. We strive to have the highest quality educational content on the Internet; so we would definitely want to know if user found an error that got through our internal QA process. Our courses are designed to be broken into short and engaging video lessons so that users are able to easily grasp the concepts. We have courses from middle school through the first two years of college. As a result, the complexity of the concept would differ depending on the level of course being viewed. We would love to get more specifics on which lessons you are referring to. Is it possible for you to submit a Customer Support ticket on our website or call our Customer Success Team at 877-266-4919 and provide that information? by Business on Feb. 19, 2016 Was this review helpful to you? YesNo Dec. 16, 2015 I am disgusted to find that my card has been charged with a sizable fee. There was no notification that the 'trial' I had signed up for was about to expire. Nor was there any opportunity to cancel the upcoming 'subscription'. I would strongly recommend anyone considering pursuing this site give it a miss immediately. I am appalled with the conduct with the conduct of this business and the sneaky, deceptive and underhanded manner in which they conduct themselves! I WANT A REFUND IMMEDIATELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This customer had a NEGATIVE experience with this business. This customer WOULD NOT recommend the business to a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. by Meagan B. on Dec. 16, 2015 | Submit a Customer Review Comments Comment from the Business:Hi ******, I'm sorry that you had a bad experience using our website. I am showing that you also contacted our Customer Success Team and they were able to promptly get this matter taken care of for you. Like they mentioned, your 5-day free trial was started on November 7th, and your account transitioned to a monthly account on November 12. Your membership was not cancelled until 35 days after the account was created, which explains why your credit card was charged the monthly fee. We try to make the terms of our free trial period as prominent as possible on our Plans Page, Welcome Email, and our Terms of Use. I apologize if this information was somehow missed or if there was a misunderstanding. I am showing that we have already issued a refund to your billing card and you seemed satisfied with the result. However, I am happy to help out if something changed or if you have any additional questions. by Business on Feb. 22, 2016 Was this review helpful to you? YesNo Oct. 13, 2015 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE. DO NOT SUBSCRIBE TO STUDY.COM, THEY WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AS THEY TOOK MINE WITHOUT WARNING. I NEVER SAW ANY EMAILS FROM THEM. I AM INFURIATED. TIS WEBSITE LEFT ME WITH A PENNY IN MY BANK ACCOUNT. I WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN. This customer had a NEGATIVE experience with this business. This customer WOULD NOT recommend the business to a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. by Stephanie S. on Oct. 13, 2015 | Submit a Customer Review Comments Comment from the Business:*********, We apologize that you had a negative experience with Study.com! Our intent is certainty not to mislead our members. It appears that your attempt to cancel was unsuccessful and that is why your account was charged once the free trial expired. Our team has reached out to you to resolve this. by Business on Oct. 15, 2015 Was this review helpful to you? YesNo Sep. 29, 2015 I am a teacher and was hoping to use Study.com to supplement my classroom instruction with home-based content. Study.com advertises itself as a content supplement for teachers but it has a long way to go to fulfill this promise. The classroom management piece is almost non-existent and the quiz answers content is left wide open for the students. Other than having adequate content it is NOT a tool for teachers (especially for $125 per month). This customer had a NEGATIVE experience with this business. This customer WOULD NOT recommend the business to a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. by Greg B. on Sep. 29, 2015 | Submit a Customer Review Comments Comment from the Business:****, We hate to hear that you have not been satisfied with your Study.com membership! We'd love to speak with you to better understand your challenges and suggestions for optimizations. Ultimately, we want you see the benefits of Study.com that our other teachers have experienced. Our team will be in touch.by Business on Oct. 15, 2015 I have contacted study.com multiple times. Only when I logged a complaint were they willing to talk to me. The site works fine for a student but not a teacher managing students.by Greg B. on Oct. 16, 2015 Comment from the Business:We have tried to contact this member multiple times but have been unsuccessful in getting a response. We hope to connect with him soon.by Business on Oct. 21, 2015 Was this review helpful to you? YesNo Apr. 21, 2015 Education portal (now renamed study.com) certainly is trying to sell their product for a premium, especially due to the fact most of the content you could find for free elsewhere such as the text only they charge $50 USD for a month or the whole package which includes added videos and text with quizzes. The video's are well presented, at least most of them, but so are a lot on YouTube which are completely free. (Not to mention some other websites) In no way are they worth a $100 USD price tag in any way shape or form. Their customer service as others that have complained on here are very correct. They come across with a very uncaring attitude and a very delayed response (this does very though, but on average it is about 7 days but I have had what the other person complained about of 2 weeks) not very helpful (could not help me with my issue at all) and just gave the overall impression they just want to charge you for an extremely overcharged price and not have to deal with anything else. Overall I give them a 1, was thinking about a 0 but if they changed their pricing (by about 1/10) then it would be possible for it to be worthwhile. At the moment it is just an extremely overpriced business model, (with sub-par customer service) which in my opinion they think they are unique? To which there is a lot of free alternatives. Best to avoid. PS I was a beta tester so I got to know the system very well, I tested it free of charge for 6 months. Even when offered the half price model (as long as I stayed subscribed) for life as a "reward" I was a little hesitant but was considering it (was working at that time not a full time student so earned a lot more money) after coming back from overseas checked some emails they had failed to charge my CC and instantly retracted the offer of my "special rate". Even after emailing them an explaining I was overseas and my cc got stolen, it was pretty much "too bad so sad we don't care" , so again the "great" customer service skills come into play. So many reasons to avoid study.com but not all hope is lost, I hope they do improve, read this review (and lack of sign ups) and change their business model and pricing. Maybe someone buys it out, wakes up, charges a flat $10 a month and actually makes some money from the thing. Because at the moment EVERY person I told (because I found out the pricing after a re-check) ZERO people have signed up and I've told every class I've had at uni (bachelors of science degree so not short on students) PLUS the teachers, ZERO have signed up. This customer had a NEGATIVE experience with this business. This customer WOULD NOT recommend the business to a friend, family member, neighbor or colleague. by Vaughan E. on Apr. 21, 2015 | Submit a Customer Review Comments Comment from the Business:Hi ******** I apologize if you had a negative experience with our Customer Success Team and website. That's certainly not our intent, but we value your feedback as we're always looking for ways to improve. Our website strives to produce the highest quality of educational content on the Internet and have thousands of members benefiting from our courses. Our members are using our website to engage their students or children, as a supplemental resource to improve their grades, or even as a way to earn college credit. Like we mentioned in our email interactions, our beta member offer was only available for a limited time and is no longer offered. It's extremely unfortunate that your credit card was stolen while you were traveling overseas. I know that this would be a frustrating situation to be in. However, we reached out to you 6 times via email in hopes of having you update your billing information. Unfortunately, you never responded to those emails or notified us that your card was stolen. If you had (even shortly after), we would have been more than happy to help you remedy this issue and avoid your current situation altogether. As a result of your account going past due for more than 10 days, we automatically cancelled the account on November 4, 2014. We received our first correspondence from you on February 28, 2015 (more than 4 months later). Since that date we have interacted 10 additional times over the last 3 months, only one of those responses exceed more than 1 business day. Over the last few months we noticed that you created 2 additional Study.com memberships under your name and we were concerned that our free trial was being abused. Creating multiple accounts or having more than one free trial period is a clear violation of our Terms of Use. You are welcome to review them again here (https://study.com/pages/terms_of_use.html). Unfortunately, both of those accounts went into a past due state since your credit card could not be charged for the agreed upon membership fee. Due to our communication, we opted to give you the benefit of the doubt and wrote off the balance owed on both these accounts. While we are sympathetic with your situation and wished that it could have been avoided (by reaching out to us sooner). We feel that we have done everything we could to provide exceptional customer service and to help you keep your account active. However, we are concerned that you are not interested in becoming a paying member on our website due to the multiple accounts that resulted in a past due state. If this is not the case, please reach back out to us and we will do all that we can to get your study.com membership back up and running.by Business on Apr. 23, 2015 Sure but who actually checks their email while they are in a foreign country having problems? Would be the last thing I do, wondering who sent me an email. Was too busy with my travel insurance company and people I was staying with over there. Regardless this is not your fault. As regarding the dates in getting back to me... I've still got those emails... 12 Nov I wrote to you, you got back to me 12th Dec, apologized for taking so long to get back to me, I'll just paste that email : Support Ticket #***************************************** Hi *******, I'm sorry it took us so long to respond to your support ticket! I looked into your account and I see that you did register for our Beta Member pricing and your 6-month free trial ended on October 26th. So in regards to what you have stated in the message above..... if I contacted you guys shortly after (which in fact I did) you would have reinstated that hey? Well I did.... not even a month later and you guys taking another month to get back to me.... saying it was too late because it had finished in October.... So in regards to your comment : Unfortunately, you never responded to those emails or notified us that your card was stolen. If you had (even shortly after), we would have been more than happy to help you remedy this issue and avoid your current situation altogether." Are you ready to rectify that? Since in fact I did contact you guys shortly after.... in fact as soon as I got home. Not my fault you took a month to get back to me?by Vaughan E. on Apr. 23, 2015 Comment from the Business:Hi *******, It was great speaking with you today on the phone. I'm glad we were able to get this matter resolved so that you can continue using Study.com courses to help with your studies. We look forward to your continued membership and helping you achieve your educational goals. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any additional questions or ever need anything.
