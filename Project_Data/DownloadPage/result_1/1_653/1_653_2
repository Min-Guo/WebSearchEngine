﻿ Media Contact Map - Best Buy Corporate News and Information Expert Service. Unbeatable Price. Weekly Ad Credit Cards Gift Cards Gift Ideas Order Status Store Finder Toggle navigation About Careers Investors  Community Relations Sustainability  Government Affairs West Coast Email Maggie Habashy Maggie Habashy I’m Maggie Habashy, and I lead media relations for the Pacific Northwest and West Coast region of the United States. I also handle PR for Best Buy’s tablets and computing product categories. I’m based in Seattle, but a Minnesotan at heart. I love to bake and would literally give up everything to travel the world. In fact, I secretly wish I hosted Travel Channel’s "Passport To" shows. Close Midwest Email Bianca Jones Bianca Jones My name is Bianca Jones and I lead media relations in the Midwest – from Idaho to Wisconsin. I also handle PR for Best Buy’s tech accessories, wearables and connected home product categories. Born and raised in Minnesota, I enjoy all of the great things the state has to offer – lakes, hockey and Juicy Lucys. Close Southwest Email Shane Kitzman Shane Kitzman I’m Shane Kitzman, and I lead media relations for the southwest United States – spanning from Alabama to Arizona. I am also the PR contact responsible for the TV, gaming and entertainment categories at Best Buy. In addition to being a staff writer for the Best Buy blog, I just so happen to be better at dive-bar karaoke than, well, everyone. Close Mid-Atlantic Email Ryan Stanzel Ryan Stanzel I’m Ryan Stanzel, and I lead Best Buy’s media relations efforts for the eastern Midwest and Mid-Atlantic regions. I also handle PR for Best Buy’s home appliance, digital imaging and exclusive brands areas. Prior to Best Buy, I worked for 15 years in pro sports, including eight with the Minnesota Wild. I’m originally from upstate New York and now live in the North Metro region of the Twin Cities. Close Northeast Email Carly Charlson Carly Charlson I’m Carly Charlson and I lead public relations for the Pacific Northwest and West Coast – everywhere from Seattle to San Diego. I am also the PR contact responsible for the tablets, wearables, laptops, and tech accessories categories at Best Buy. I’m a staff writer for the Best Buy corporate blog by day, and a TV binge watcher by night. (Fun fact: I once watched the entire series of Friday Night Lights in ten days.) Close Southeast Email Danielle Schumann Danielle Schumann As media relations lead for our Southeast region, I support Best Buy stores in the facilitation of local/regional news stories. Additionally, I handle enterprise-wide corporate communications, including work with our Best Buy Mobile specialty stores. During the summer, I keep a community garden in Minneapolis and no matter the season, you can find me at home cooking up a delicious meal. Close Shop BestBuy.com® © 2016 Best Buy.
