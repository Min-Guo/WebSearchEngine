Kant's Theistic Solution

KANT'S THEISTIC SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF TRANSCENDENTAL THEOLOGY by Stephen Palmquist 
1. The Problem of Transcendental Theology
	Kant's transcendental philosophy begins with an attempt to solve the 
theoretical problem of the possibility of synthetic a priori judgments.  In 
solving this epistemological problem Kant demonstrates how transcendental 
knowledge (i.e., knowledge of the synthetic a priori conditions for the 
possibility of experience) is possible only when its application is confined to 
the realm of empirical knowledge (i.e., to experience).  He argues that 
space, time, and the twelve categories form the transcendental boundary line 
between what we can and cannot know.  But this 'solution' itself calls 
attention to an even more significant problem:  what is the status of that 
which lies outside the boundary of possible empirical knowledge?  Kant 
reveals as early as CPR xxix-xxxi1 that this metaphysical problem of how 
to verify the fundamental human ideas of 'God, freedom, and immortality', 
upon which he believes all religion and morality depend, constitutes the 
deepest and most urgent form of the 'transcendental problem'.  It should 
therefore come as no surprise when he devotes the entire Transcendental 
Dialectic, the largest section of the first Critique, to the task of solving this 
ubiquitous perplexity of human reason.
	According to Kant our ideas of God, freedom, and immortality 
inevitably arise in the human mind as a result of our attempts to unify and 
systematize our empirical knowledge.  In other words, reason naturally 
seeks for something beyond the limits of empirical knowledge which can 
supply unity and coherence to the diversity of facts which fall within that 
boundary.  The problem is that the transcendental conditions which enable 
us to gain knowledge in the empirical world are unable to perform their 
function with respect to such ideas, because the ideas abstract from all 
sensible content, whereas the transcendental conditions (space, time and the 
categories) all require such content.
	As is well known, Kant devoted considerable effort in the 
Transcendental Dialectic to the task of pointing out the implications of this 
transcendental problem for rational psychology (with its proofs of the 
immortality of the soul), rational cosmology (with its proofs of 
transcendental freedom), and rational theology (with its proofs of the 
existence of God).  Interpreters often assume Kant sought to demonstrate 
the total uselessness of all such 'speculative' disciplines, especially when it 
comes to theology, where he offers his radical criticisms of the three 
traditional proofs for the existence of God.  Since Kant's division and 
negative assessment of these proofs has become common knowledge 
among theologians and philosophers of religion, there is no need to rehearse 
his position here.
	The attentive reader of Kant's writings will notice that he regarded 
the failure of the traditional proofs for God's existence not as closing the 
books on the issue, but as posing one of the most important problems for 
transcendental philosophy to resolve.  Although some theologians fear that 
Kant's criticism of traditional rational theology could, in the long run, have 
a detrimental effect on the ordinary religious believer, Kant's disagreement 
with such a 'sophisticated' conjecture is explicit and to the point:
In religion the knowledge of God is properly based on faith alone ....  [So] 
it is not necessary for this belief [i.e., in God] to be susceptible of logical 
proof....  [For] sophistication is the error of refusing to accept any religion 
not based on a theology which can be apprehended by our reason....  
Sophistication in religious matters is a dangerous thing; our reasoning 
powers are limited and reason can err and we cannot prove everything.  A 
speculative basis is a very weak foundation for religion...  [LE 86-7; cf. CJ 
480-1]
The problem, then is to discover the proper foundation which can be put in 
the place of speculation.
	What is not so well known is that Kant saw his philosophical 
System not only as posing this problem, but as offering at least four distinct 
ways of solving it.  So, even though Kant begins his theology on an 
essentially negative theological note, believing he has been able 'to discover 
the fallacy in any attempt [to prove God's existence theoretically], and so to 
nullify its claims' [CPR 667], nevertheless he devotes considerable effort to 
the task of showing how an honest recognition of the limitations of human 
reason leaves ample room for drawing affirmative theological conclusions in 
a theoretical discussion of God's existence and nature.  In what follows I 
will examine these affirmations in turn, with a view towards assessing the 
common assumption that his theology defends an entirely negative position, 
suuch as deism, and thereby ascertaining his true attitude towards theology.

2. God as a Regulative Idea
	Kant believes it is important for us to form some judgment on the 
question of God's existence despite the transcendental limitations imposed 
on human knowledge.  He explains that there is
a real need associated with reason itself [which] makes judging necessary 
even if ignorance with respect to the details required for judging limits us...  
If then it has been demonstrated that there can be here neither intuition of 
objects nor anything similar to such intuitions by which we could exhibit 
appropriate objects to our broadened concepts and thus make sure of their 
real possibility, nothing remains for us except first to test the concept with 
which we venture beyond all possible experience to see if it is free of 
contradictions, and then to bring at least the relation of this object to objects 
of experience under pure concepts of reason.  By this we do not make the 
object sensuous.  We only fit something supersensuous to thought in 
reason's empirical perspective, for without this precaution we could make 
no use of such a concept and would rave instead of think.2
Kant's criticism of the traditional proofs is actually designed to fulfil the 
first of these tasks, by demonstrating that belief in God cannot be logically 
contradictory, since God's existence, regarded as a constitutive part of the 
world, can never be proved or disproved, on the grounds that an intuition of 
God is, in principle, impossible.  The second task is fulfilled in a lengthy 
Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic [CPR 671-732], where Kant 
offers an alternative explanation of the epistemological status of the idea of 
God--an explanation which is often not treated very seriously by 
commentators.
	Kant's first theological affirmation provides an explanation for a 
commonly experienced paradox, which Kant expresses in CPR 643 by 
asking:  'Why are we constrained to assume that some one among existing 
things is in itself necessary, and yet at the same time to shrink back from the 
existence of such a being as from an abyss?'  Dialectical illusion results only 
if we try to subdue one of these natural tendencies.  Those who try to prove 
God's existence theoretically are repressing the latter, while those who 
categorically deny God's existence are repressing the former.  But if the 
truth which lies behind both tendencies is grasped, both errors can be 
avoided.  The situation which gives rise to this paradox is that 'I can never 
complete the regress to the conditions of existence save by assuming a 
necessary being, and yet am never in a position to begin [such a regress] 
with such a being' [CPR 643-4].
	The two sides of this paradox can be made compatible by 
recognizing the 'merely heuristic and regulative' character of the principles 
underlying each side:
The one [principle] prescribes that we are to philosophise about nature as if 
there were a necessary first ground for all that belongs to existence--solely, 
however, for the purpose of bringing systematic unity into our knowledge, 
by always pursuing such an idea, as an imagined ultimate ground.  The 
other warns us not to regard any determination whatsoever of existing 
things as such an ultimate ground...  [CPR 644-5e.a.]
Whereas all theoretical arguments about the existence of God are bound to 
fail in their attempt to establish knowledge of God as an ideal object, these 
two principles suggest that the concept of God can have a valid use after all 
as long as it is regarded, less ambitiously, as an idea of reason.  Since I 
have discussed the general character of this regulative employment of the 
ideas in some detail elsewhere [see FKK 452-5 and KE 190-6], I will 
proceed directly to a discussion of its implications for our theoretical 
understanding of the concept of God.
	A theoretical discussion of God's existence and attributes, Kant 
argues, cannot be based 'upon the knowledge of such a being but upon its 
idea only' [CPR 729e.a.]. From the standpoint of theoretical reason our 
idea of God
is postulated only problematically (since we cannot reach it through any of 
the concepts of the understanding) in order that we may view all connection 
of the things of the world of sense as if they had their ground in [it]...  In 
thus proceeding, our sole purpose is to secure systematic unity...  [709]
In such usage God is 'an idea which reason is constrained to form as the 
regulative principle of its investigation of nature' [725].  As such, it is used 
as a principle for viewing empirical objects from a hypothetical, not an 
empirical, perspective.  (The latter would be a constitutive use of the idea in 
reference to the world.)  
	Kant explains the proper use of an idea as follows:
I think to myself merely the relation of a being, in itself completely 
unknown to me, to the greatest possible systematic unity of the universe, 
solely for the purpose of using [the unconditioned object] as a schema of the 
regulative principle of the greatest possible empirical employment of my 
reason.  [707]
The purpose of Kant's whole treatment of the idea of God in CPR is to 
establish the right to use this theoretical concept from other, nontheoretical 
standpoints [see above, note 2].  His criticism of the traditional proofs does 
this by demonstrating that, although the concept cannot be instantiated in 
experience, it is at least not self-contradictory.  The function of this concept 
as a regulative idea can therefore be put forward as a reasonable hypothesis 
(i.e., as plausible, though not provable), even from the standpoint of 
theoretical reason.  Far from being an afterthought, this theory is at the core 
Kant's theological concern.  As Despland points out in KHR 146:  'The 
unique strength of criticism is that "rational" is not restricted in meaning to 
cognitive.  The Ideas of reason can be thought rationally without being 
objectified into possible objects of knowledge.'
	'Hypotheses', Kant urges in CPR 805, are 'permissible only as 
weapons of war, and only for the purpose of defending a right, not in order 
to establish it.'  They can be invaluable tools, when used 'in self-defence', 
in order to nullify 'the sophistical arguments by which our opponent 
professes to invalidate this assertion [of God's existence]' [804-5].  Yet 
they cannot be used dogmatically, since the sceptic can also produce 
opposing hypotheses.  Since theoretical reason 'does not...favour either of 
the two parties', hypotheses can be used 'only in polemical fashion.'  So a 
proper view of hypotheses limits dogmatists by refusing them knowledge, 
while yet limiting sceptics by upholding the right to believe.  These warring 
parties, Kant explains, both 'lie in ourselves'; and the task of criticism is to 
remove 'the root of these disturbances' in order to 'establish a permanent 
peace' [805-6].  Once we recognize that hypotheses, 'although they are but 
leaden weapons', are required 'for our complete equipment' in fulfilling this 
purpose, we will see that there is 'nothing to fear in all this, but much to 
hope for; namely, that we may gain for ourselves a possession which can 
never again be contested.'  By establishing peace in our system of 
theoretical knowledge, the regulative use of the idea of God directs our 
attention forward to the other Critical standpoints in anticipation of a more 
complete justification for belief in God.
	This affirmation of the benefits of the regulative employment of our 
idea of God is frequently rejected prematurely by Kant's critics.  One of the 
most common criticisms is that science (especially since Darwin) simply has 
no use for postulating 'the idea of God...as a heuristic device in the 
empirical study of nature' [KRT 145].  But this is based on a complete 
misunderstanding of the perspective from which Kant is speaking:  he never 
intends the ideas to be used as regulative principles from an empirical 
perspective, such as that adopted by the natural scientist; for he insists that 
'just because it is a mere idea, [the idea of God] is altogether incapable...of 
enlarging our knowledge in regard to what exists' [CPR 630-1].  Hence it 
cannot serve as the constitutive 'ground of the systematic order of the 
world' [709; cf. 724-5].  This function is fulfilled on the material side by 
the thing in itself and on the formal side by reason's architectonic forms [see 
e.g., 723-4].
	Instead, the ideas are to function regulatively only in the context of 
reason's special hypothetical perspective.  To think otherwise is to ignore 
the fact that metaphysics 'does not need the ideas for the purposes of natural 
science, but in order to pass beyond nature' [395n].  In other words, these 
regulative principles concern how 'to philosophise about nature' [CPR 644, 
q.a.], not how to investigate nature scientifically.  Accordingly, Kant 
harshly condemns the latter approach:
To have recourse to God...in explaining the [physical] arrangements of 
nature and their changes is...a complete confession that one has come to the 
end of his philosophy, since he is compelled to assume something of which 
in itself he otherwise has no concept in order to conceive the possibility of 
something he sees before his very eyes.3
Just as the regulative use of an idea assumes it not to have 'creative power', 
but to 'have practical power..., and form the basis of the possible perfection 
of certain actions' [CPR 597], so also such regulative usage implies nothing 
about how we are to go about gathering empirical knowledge, but only 
about how we are to structure our beliefs about the source of the ultimate 
unity of that knowledge:  much as a (e.g., religious) vision of the 'not yet' 
can act as a powerful force pulling us forward towards the realization of a 
hope, the idea motivates us to search for systematic unity in our 
philosophical explanations.4
	Another frequent complaint against Kant's plea that we be satisfied 
with regarding God as a regulative idea is made by those theologians who 
are (as Kant says with respect to the moral philosophers of his day) 
'dedicated to the omnipotence of theoretical reason' [Kt6:377].  He 
continues:
...the discomfort they feel at not being able to explain what lies entirely 
beyond the sphere of physiological explanation [e.g., the idea of God] 
provokes them to a general call to arms, as it were, to withstand that Idea, 
no matter how exalting this very prerogative of man--his capacity for such 
an Idea--may be.
That is to say, they reject the notion of God as an idea not because it is 
incoherent, but because it does not provide what they are looking for, viz. 
certain knowledge of God's existence and nature.  Because Kant says, for 
example, that 'this Idea proceeds entirely from our own reason and we 
ourselves make it' [442], they disregard his many other claims to believe in 
a real, living God, as in traditional theism.5  Such a premature rejection of 
his position fails to recognize that, as in virtually every other aspect of his 
System, Kant often gives different answers to the same question when 
different perspectives are assumed.  Hence, viewing 'God' from the 
theoretical standpoint as a man-made idea does not prevent us from adopting 
some other standpoint in order to affirm that a real, transcendent God 
actually exists.

3. Natural Theology 
	Kant's theory concerning the regulative idea of God is actually the 
least important of his three ways of affirming the rationality of theology; for 
'the conception of a Deity...can never be evolved merely according to 
principles of reason's theoretical standpoint' [Kt7:400].  So in addition to 
such transcendental theology, he develops his own type of natural theology 
in the second and third Critiques.  A thorough examination of his moral and 
physicotheological arguments for God's existence will help to reveal the 
systematic character of his general concept of God and to demonstrate the 
richness and depth of this 'guiding-thread' [cf. CJ 389] of his System.
	Kant affirms the physicotheological proof in the third Critique, yet 
this does not nullify the limitations he places on it in CPR; for the standpoint 
from which it is discussed in CJ is judicial rather than theoretical. The same 
theoretical concept (God) is still under consideration; from the outset, 
however, Kant is now aiming to establish not theoretical knowledge, but 
only an empirical justification of a practical belief.  Even in CPR Kant 
explicitly allows for such a usage:  he argues that we are 'undoubtedly' 
permitted, if not required, 'to assume a wise and omnipotent Author of the 
world', as long as we realize that such an assumption does not in any way 
'extend our knowledge beyond the field of experience' [725-6].  Elsewhere, 
he develops this idea a bit further:
Physicotheology...can enlighten and give intuitive appeal to our concepts of 
God.  But it cannot have any determinate concept of God.  For only reason 
can represent completeness and totality.  In physicotheology I see God's 
power.  But can I say determinately, this is omnipotence or the highest 
degree of power?  [LPT 32-3]
The implicit answer, of course, is 'no'. For although it has a constructive 
role to play, physicotheology on its own is 'unable to...serve as the 
foundation of a theology which is itself in turn to form the basis of religion' 
[CPR 656].  Instead, Kant intends it to point the way outward from 
experience to moral activity, where theology has a more secure foundation.
	Kant argues in CJ 389 that empirical reflection on 'the clearly 
manifest nexus of things according to final causes' requires us to conceive 
of 'a world-cause acting according to ends, that is, an intelligent cause--
however rash and undemonstrable a principle this might be for the 
determinant judgment.'  He bases this conclusion on the specific 
phenomenon of finality in our experience of the world:
...the nature of our faculty of reason is such that without an Author and 
Governor of the world, who is also a moral Lawgiver [see below], we are 
wholly unable to render intelligible to ourselves the possibility of a finality, 
related to the moral law, and its Object, such as exists in this final end.  
[455]
In particular Kant emphasizes that 'the end for which nature itself exists' is 
man, and that 'it is upon the definite idea of this end that the definite 
conception of such a supreme intelligent World-Cause, and, consequently, 
the possibility of a theology, depend' [437].  Viewed from the judicial 
standpoint of CJ rather than the theoretical standpoint of CPR, this 
argument is, as Wood points out in KMR 174, directed not so much to the 
theoretical philosopher as to the ordinary man:  'the ordinary man "sees" 
nature as the work of God, and discerns in it--what no amount of empirical 
evidence could have demonstrated--the signs of a divine and morally 
purposive creation' [176].  Yet even from the standpoint of CJ 
physicotheology on its own is quite limited, for experience 'can never lift us 
above nature to the end of its real existence or thus raise us to a definite 
conception of such a higher Intelligence' [CJ 438; see also LPT 38].  Thus 
'physical teleology urges us to go in quest of a theology.  But it can never 
produce one' [CJ 440]; for 'physico-theology...is of no use to theology 
except as a preparation or propaedeutic and is only sufficient for this 
purpose when supplemented by a further principle on which it can rely' 
[442].
	Rather than depending on the speculative proofs of transcendental 
theology, however, Kant's physicotheology depends on the proof provided 
by moral theology from the practical standpoint:  'underlying our procedure 
[in physicotheology] is an idea of a Supreme Being, which rests on an 
entirely different standpoint [than the judicial], namely the practical' [CJ 
438].  Kant sums up the preparatory function of physicotheology in DV 
481, where, in his example of 'a moral catechism' [479], the final comment 
of the pupil is:
For we see in the works of nature, which we can judge, a wisdom so 
widespread and profound that we can explain it to ourselves only by the 
ineffably great art of a creator of the world.  And from this we have cause, 
when we turn to the moral order...to expect there a rule no less wise.

4. The Moral Argument as the Basis for Kant's Theism
	Kant's moral argument for the existence of God is the only aspect of 
his solution to the problem of transcendental theology which has been duly 
recognized by his commentators.  In its simplest form, his argument is 
fairly straightforward.  After arguing that the highest good consists of the 
distribution of happiness to each person in proportion to his or her virtue, 
Kant points out that, given the nature of human virtue (viz., that it often 
requires us to deny our own happiness in order to obey the voice of duty), 
man on his own is unlikely to bring into being this ideal end of morality.  
Yet if the end or purpose of morality proves to be unattainable, moral action 
itself will be irrational.  Hence, anyone who wishes to regard moral action 
as rational is constrained to postulate whatever is necessary to conceive of 
the possibility of the highest good.  As is well known, Kant argues that the 
immortality of the soul and the existence of God are the two postulates 
which alone can save morality from the abyss of meaninglessness.
	Although Kant's basic argument is familiar enough, its intended 
force is often misunderstood, especially by those who fail to take into 
consideration the different perspectives in Kant's System.  In the first place, 
Kant's moral argument has little, if anything, to do with his theory of 
religion (a point often misunderstood by those who write on the latter 
subject).  Instead, the postulate of God is intended to perform its function 
exclusively within the final stage of Kant's practical (moral) system, where 
it suggests that rational moral agents are, in fact, acting as if God exists 
whenever they act morally, whether or not they claim to believe in God.  In 
other words, God's existence, though not theoretically provable, is 
nevertheless a necessary assumption for any moral agent who wishes to 
conceive of the highest good as being realizable (and therefore, of moral 
action as being ultimately rational).  
	What then are the specific implications of Kant's moral argument for 
the theologian's attempt to prove the existence of God?  Kant's argument, 
as summarized in CJ 446, is that every moral agent
needs a moral Intelligence; because he exists for an end, and this end 
demands a Being that has formed both him and the world [i.e., both 
freedom and nature] with that end in view....  Hence...there is in our moral 
habits of thought a foundation for...form[ing] a representation depicting a 
pure moral need for the real existence of a Being, whereby our morality 
gains in strength or even obtains --at least on the side of our representation--
an extension of area, that is to say, is given a new object for its exercise.
The resulting concept of 'a moral Legislator' has no theoretical value; yet, 
Kant continues,
the source of this disposition is unmistakable.  It is the original bent of our 
nature, as a subjective principle, that will not let us be satisfied, in our 
review of the world, with the finality which it derives through natural 
causes, but leads us to introduce into it an underlying supreme Cause 
governing nature according to moral laws.  --In addition...we feel ourselves 
urged by the moral law to strive after a universal highest end, while yet we 
feel ourselves, and all nature too, incapable of its attainment....  Thus we 
have a pure moral ground derived from practical reason for admitting this 
Cause (since we may do so without contradiction), if for no better reason, 
in order that we may not run the risk of regarding such striving as quite idle 
in its effects, and of allowing it to flag in consequence.
	After presenting his moral argument for the existence of God in the 
second Critique [CPrR], Kant asks:  'Is our knowledge really widened in 
such a way by pure practical reason, and is that which was transcendent for 
speculative reason immanent in practical reason?  Certainly, but only from a 
practical standpoint' [133].  Earlier, he warns against assuming that the 
conclusions of his practical system merely 'serve to fill out gaps in the 
critical system of speculative reason' [7].  Kant does on a few occasions 
make careless remarks, such as that 'a faith in God built on this [moral] 
foundation is as certain as a mathematical demonstration' [LPT 40].  (He 
should at least have added that there is a crucial perspectival difference 
between the type of certainty we have in each case.)  But such remarks 
should not be given priority over his many other, more carefully worded, 
comments regarding the perspectival structure of his System.  For, as he 
states so clearly in CPR 857, 'no one will be able to boast that he knows 
that there is a God [i.e., from a theoretical standpoint]... No, my conviction 
is not logical but moral certainty...'.  Thus Wood insists 'it would be a great 
mistake to see in the God of Kant's moral faith no more than an abstract, 
metaphysical idea.  For Kant moral faith in God is, in it[s] most profound 
and personal signification, the moral man's trust in God.'6
	Kant's moral argument, therefore, is not to be regarded as 'an 
incontrovertible proof', as the traditional theoretical proofs attempt to be 
[CPR 665].  As Kant says in CJ 450-1:
This moral argument is not intended to supply an objectively valid proof of 
the existence of God.  It is not meant to demonstrate to the sceptic that there 
is a God, but that he must adopt the assumption of this proposition as a 
maxim of his practical reason, if he wishes to think in a manner consistent 
with morality.
As a practical 'presupposition' of our moral activity, it 'cannot be brought to 
a higher degree of certainty than the acknowledgement that it is the most 
reasonable opinion for us men' [CPrR 142].  Accordingly, Kant describes it 
as a 'doctrinal belief' [CPR 853], which means it is, 'from an objective 
perspective, an expression of modesty, and yet at the same time, from a 
subjective perspective, an expression of the firmness of our confidence' 
[855].  For one who accepts this practical postulate and decides to believe in 
God must resolve within himself 'not [to] give up this belief' [CPrR 143].
	By accepting the conclusions established by moral theology, and 
supported by physicotheology, especially the conclusion that theology 
should be 'founded on the moral principle, namely that of freedom, and 
adapted, therefore, to reason's practical standpoint', Kant believes theology 
might 'better fulfil [its] final objective purpose' [CJ 479]. The limitation of 
basing theology on practical rather than theoretical reason is that its 
conclusions are now 'of immanent use only' [CPR 847]:
[Moral theology] enables us to fulfil our vocation in this present world by 
showing us how to adapt ourselves to the system of all ends [i.e., to the 
practical standpoint], and by warning us against the fanaticism, and indeed 
the impiety, of abandoning the guidance of a morally legislative reason in 
the right conduct of our lives, in order to derive guidance directly from the 
idea of the Supreme Being [i.e., from the theoretical standpoint].  For we 
should then be making a transcendental employment of moral theology; and 
that, like a transcendent use of pure speculation, must pervert and frustrate 
the ultimate ends of reason.  [847]
However, once its purely immanent use is understood, the common 
criticism that Kant's moral postulates are merely 'a side gesture, [pointing] 
beyond the limits which he himself had drawn', is immediately seen to be 
invalid.7
	The importance of this point can hardly be overemphasized:  Kant's 
moral proof of God's existence is in no sense intended to satisfy the 
requirements of the theoretical standpoint; rather it directs our attention away 
from the theoretical, away from scientific knowledge, whether 
transcendental, logical, empirical, or hypothetical/speculative, and towards 
the practical standpoint, which serves as the only context in which the 
concept of God can be rationally justified.8  He states this as plainly as one 
could expect in LPT 39:
Thus all speculation depends...on the transcendental concept [of an 
absolutely necessary being].  But if we posit that it is not correct, would we 
then have to give up the knowledge of God?  Not at all.  For then we would 
only lack the scientific knowledge that God exists.  But a great field would 
still remain to us, and this would be the belief or faith that God exists.  This 
faith we will derive a priori from moral principles.  Hence if...we raise 
doubts about these speculative proofs...we will not thereby undermine faith 
in God.  Rather, we will clear the road for practical proofs.  We are merely 
throwing out the false presumptions of human reason when it tries from 
itself to demonstrate the existence of God with apodictic certainty.  But from 
moral principles we will assume a faith in God as the principle of every 
religion.
In CJ 482 he deliberates with equal clarity:
...we shall not feel that the assurance produced by this [moral] line of proof 
falls in any way short of the final purposes it has in view [viz. establishing a 
rational foundation for religion] provided we are clear on the point that an 
argument of this kind only proves the existence of God in a way that 
satisfies the moral side of our nature, that is, from a practical standpoint....  
[Therefore,] while the categories are here used on behalf of the knowledge 
of God, they are not directed to the intrinsic, and for us inscrutable, nature 
of God.9
	When we read Kant giving one or another of his various accounts of 
God's nature,10 we must always keep in mind that he is not contradicting 
his own theoretical principles by suggesting that we can know God's 
attributes after all, but only urging that, despite our inherent ignorance of 
God's essence, necessitated by the perspectival nature of human rationality, 
it is legitimate for practical purposes to make assumptions about God, as 
long as we recognize the dependence of such descriptions on our own 
perspectives, and so use the resulting 'knowledge' only as an aid in coping 
with our earthly existence (especially with respect to our moral activity).  
One of the main purposes of CPR is to prepare the way for such a theology 
by replacing the positive noumenon with the negative noumenon--i.e., by 
replacing the rationalist belief in a speculative realm which transcends the 
phenomenal world with the Critical belief in a practical realm which is 
revealed in and through moral experience.  Any attempt to possess God 
must therefore be given up and replaced by a willingness to be possessed by 
God.
	Kant suggests in CJ 444 that 'all transcendental attributes [of God], 
...attributes that are presupposed in relation to such a final end, will have to 
be regarded as belonging to the Original Being.  --In this way moral 
teleology supplements the deficiency of physical teleology, and for the first 
time establishes a [moral] theology.'11  Thus the moral theology towards 
which physical teleology directs our attention provides the only adequate 
philosophical basis for a belief in the existence of God, and so for a 
regulative use of the idea of God in theoretical contexts [see CPR 664] by 
supplying not knowledge but 'a conviction of the existence of a supreme 
being--a conviction which bases itself on moral laws' [660n].  With this 
foundation, our concept of God 'meets the joint requirements alike of 
insight into nature and moral wisdom--and no objection of the least 
substance can be brought against the possibility of such an idea' [CJ 462].  
With the existence of God thus vindicated as a legitimate object of belief, we 
can now conclude by stepping back and briefly assessing the character of 
Kant's own attitude towards belief in God.
 	Kant's approach to theology is typically characterized as implying, 
in the words of Cupitt, 'a non-cognitive philosophy of religion which leaves 
the believer to be sustained in a harsh world by nothing but pure moral 
faith'.12  But in fact, Kant's theological and religious views are not so 
'bleak and austere' as is often assumed.  On the contrary, such an 
assumption, like most misinterpretations of Kant, rests on a failure to 
understand how the principle of perspective operates in his System.  It is 
true that his practical postulates as such are not much help in facing the 
harsh realities of human existence, but they are not primarily intended to 
fulfil such an empirical role; for Kant offers us a good deal more in the way 
of equipping us with tools to cope with reality.  The most significant of 
these, which concern Kant's view of God as participating in human 
morality and as relating on a personal basis with his creatures, are beyond 
the scope of our present inquiry.13
	Nevertheless, the foregoing account of Kant's solution to the 
problem of transcendental theology has, I hope, made abundantly clear that 
Kant's theology is not that of a 'deist', as is so often assumed, but is the 
rational framework for a 'theism' which has rarely been adequately 
appreciated by his interpreters.  This failure is due in part to the fact that 
theologians and philosophers of religion often group Kant on the side of 
those who argue 'that God is utterly unknowable', and that therefore 
'theology is a useless effort'.14  The latter conclusion does seem to follow 
naturally from the deistic assumption that God is utterly unknowable, an 
assumption Kant apparently adopts in his denial of our ability to intuit God.  
But this interpretation reflects a rather narrow acquaintance with Kant's 
writings.  For, even in the Preface to Religion within the Bounds of Bare 
Reason Kant says with no apparent irony that the philosopher and the 
theologian should see themselves not as rivals, out to destroy each other, 
but as co-workers, mutual friends and companions.
	Kant defines theology as 'the system of our knowledge of the 
highest being'; it 'does not refer to the sum total of all possible knowledge 
of God, but only to what human reason meets with in God' [LPT 23; cf. 
CPR 659].  The 'knowledge of everything in God', which Kant calls 
'theologia archetypa', is unattainable for man, while 'that part of God which 
lies in human nature', the knowledge of which he calls 'theologia ectypa', is 
attainable.15  Within the latter he distinguishes between deism and theism:  
'Those who accept only a transcendental theology [i.e., knowledge of God 
based on the theoretical standpoint] are called deists; those who also admit a 
natural theology [i.e., knowledge of God based on the practical or judicial 
standpoints] are called theists' [CPR 659; see also 660-1; LPT 28-9].  Kant 
therefore believes the distinction between the theist and the deist concerns 
not only one's theoretical standpoint, but also one's particular (moral and 
empirical) experiences of the God whom such theories are intended to 
describe.  Deists, then, are those who, after reflecting logically and/or 
transcendentally on the concept of God, come up with a positive answer to 
the question of His existence.  Theists are open to these two perspectives, 
but regard them as only secondary to the more basic use of empirical and/or 
hypothetical perspectives in developing a theoretical affirmation of God.  
Only from the latter two perspectives can God be regarded not just as 'an 
original being or supreme cause' (as in deism), but also as 'a supreme being 
who through understanding and freedom is the Author of all things'.  Thus, 
Kant asserts 'that the deist believes in a God, the theist in a living God' 
[CPR 660-1].
	Kant demonstrates in numerous ways that he is, given the above 
definitions, a thoroughly theistic philosopher.  Not the least of the reasons 
for regarding Kant as a theist is that, as we have seen, he replaces the 
deist's reliance on the theoretical standpoint with a theology firmly rooted in 
the practical standpoint.  Thus he confesses in CPR 856:  'I inevitably 
believe in the existence of God..., and I am certain that nothing can shake 
this belief, since my moral principles would thereby be themselves 
overthrown, and I cannot disdain them without becoming abhorrent in my 
own eyes.'  Ironically, the very criticisms of the traditional theoretical 
arguments for God's existence with which Kant begins his critical theology, 
though they were designed to pave the way for a practical theism, are (as we 
have noted) often the basis upon which Kant is misinterpreted as being 
himself a deist!16
	Kant is indeed acutely aware of the problems posed to theological 
knowledge by human ignorance:  'Both in theology and in religion, but 
particularly in theology, we are handicapped by ignorance' [LE 85].  
Sometimes even when we think we have knowledge, he tells us, we 
actually have 'no concept at all' of God [LPT 24].  But as Wood points out, 
this does not make him a deist [KMR 155,164], for he means by this that 
'our concept of God is an idea of reason' [KRT 79], rather than a concept 
which rises out of abstraction from appearances.  For Kant holds that 'we 
cannot intuit God, but can only believe in him' [LE 99]; yet 'in order to 
believe in God it is not necessary to know for certain that God exists' [81].  
On the contrary, as Wood again conveys Kant's view, 'the "minimum" 
theology it is necessary to have is a belief that God is at least possible' 
[KMR 31].  Kant believes the ideas of 'God, freedom, and the immortality 
of the soul are the problems to whose solution, as their ultimate goal, all the 
laborious preparations of metaphysics are directed' [CJ 473]; and his 
System of Perspectives is intended to solve these problems once and for all 
by developing a theistic philosophy which rejects the false foundations 
offered by theoretical reason.  Hence, in a choice between atheism, deism, 
anthropomorphism and theism, Kant would undoubtedly favour theism.17 
	Because Kant's theology guards against what might be called 
'gnostic' errors (such as anthropomorphism), into which dogmatic 
theologians and philosophers of religion repeatedly fall, he is branded an 
agnostic.  And because his theology likewise takes seriously the objections 
advanced by the atheist, he is branded a deist.  Yet a perspectival 
interpretation reveals that his response to the problem of transcendental 
theology was that of neither a deist nor an agnostic, but a theist in a quite 
profound sense of the word.  Ironically, those who label Kant as a deist or 
an agnostic are often those who would call themselves theists because of 
their affirmative response to the traditional arguments of speculative 
theology.  Yet for Kant this is not good enough:  no one can claim to be a 
theist on the strength merely of logical ingenuity, for theism depends on a 
belief in a God who manifests Himself as 'a living God' in our immediate 
experience, whereas the ontological and cosmological arguments portray 
God 'wholly separate from any experience' [LPT 30].  If anyone is a deist, 
then, it is not Kant, who believes in a God who purposely hides his true 
nature from us, but gives us enough evidence to make a reasoned step of 
faith, after which we are able to understand God's nature with sufficient 
clarity in terms of our finite human perspectives; rather it is those who put 
all their trust in the powers of theoretical reason and toil endlessly and in 
vain to attain knowledge which is not to be had by us men.  The religious 
implications of Kant's theism are not always entirely consistent with 
orthodox Christianity; yet they are not as inconsistent as is often assumed.  
For, although it is couched in the difficult terminology of a highly complex 
philosophical System, Kant's theism is not significantly different (in its 
general intent, at least) from the theism expressed by the writer of 2 Cor. 
4:7 when he proclaims that 'the transcendent power [he huperbol� t�s 
dun�me�s] belongs to God and not to us'.

2. WOT 136-7.  Kant continues by explaining that 'the right of a need of 
reason enters as the right of a subjective ground to presuppose or assume 
something which it may not pretend to know on objective grounds' [137].  
From the former, theoretical standpoint, this 'need of reason' to 'assume the 
existence of God' is 'conditional':  the assumption only 'needs' to be made 
'when we wish to judge concerning the first cause of all contingent things, 
particularly in the organization of ends actually present in the world' [139].  
But from the latter, practical standpoint, 'the need is unconditional; here we 
are compelled to presuppose the existence of God not just if we wish to 
judge but because we must judge' [139].
3. CPrR 138; see also LPT 25-6.  This seems at first to apply equally to 
Kant's own assumption of the thing in itself, which he does believe to be 
philosophically sound.  However, he is speaking here from an empirical 
perspective, in the context of which the thing in itself, as positive 
noumenon, is indeed superfluous [see section 3 of SPO]; Kant's use of the 
thing in itself does not fall under this criticism because it assumes the 
transcendental perspective.  Hence, when we read Kant warning us that 'a 
presumptuous readiness to appeal to supernatural explanations is a pillow 
for a lazy understanding' [On the Form and Principles of the Sensible and 
Intelligible World (Kant's Inaugural Dissertation), p.418, as translated in 
KPR 45], we must be careful not to interpret this too harshly, as does Webb 
when he says this claim means that 'the assumption of the supernatural is 
excluded on "critical" principles' [KPR 45].  For as we have seen, Kant 
actually encourages such an assumption in the appropriate circumstances, as 
long as it is put forward without a presumptuous attitude (i.e., as a 
theoretical hypothesis rather than a dogmatic knowledge-claim).  If Kant's 
advice to us in such passages is that supernatural explanations are always 
inappropriate, then why does he himself make use of the God hypothesis 
throughout his writings?  Rather, his message is that we must be careful to 
use them wisely--i.e., in such a way that they do not prevent us from 
relentlessly seeking natural explanations wherever possible.	
4. Kant describes a 'hypothesis' in CPrR 126 as 'a ground of explanation'.  
As such, a proper understanding of his theory of the regulative use of the 
idea of God from the hypothetical perspective reveals it to be remarkably 
similar to modern attempts to defend God's existence as the best 
'explanatory hypothesis' [see e.g. PC 441].  There are differences, of 
course, such as that the modern versions, while they perhaps benefit from 
their freedom from Kant's rather difficult and old-fashioned terminology, 
often suffer unnecessarily by mixing different perspectives uncritically 
(e.g., by assuming that rigorous logical argumentation is the primary, if not 
the only, tool available to defend or refute such hypotheses).  But the two 
approaches are alike to the extent that they both attempt a theoretical defence 
of God's existence not on the basis that the God-hypothesis enables us to 
provide a better scientific explanation of the available data, but rather on the 
basis that the available data point beyond themselves to something which 
can best be explained philosophically in terms of the God-hypothesis.  Thus 
in both cases the theoretical argument, when properly constructed, assumes 
a hypothetical, rather than an empirical, perspective.
5. The issue of Kant's theism will be discussed in more detail at the end of 
this paper.
6. KMR 161.  Unfortunately, many interpreters make the very mistake in 
interpreting the underlying connotations of Kant's moral argument that 
Wood is warning against here.  Webb, for example, claims that Kant's 
moral argument 'certainly is in no way calculated to express the religious 
man's conviction of the reality of the object of his worship' [KPR 66].  If 
'the religious man's conviction' here refers to traditional, uncritical ways of 
believing in God, then of course Webb is correct, since the argument is 
directed to 'the moral man'.  But the words 'in no way' are misleading, 
since (as I argue in DKR) Kant does intend his argument not only to be 
compatible with a religious standpoint, but also to provide a rational 
foundation for the fuller conception of the God of religion, as expounded in 
his own book, Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason [i.e., RLRA].
7. See CPK 470.  Of course, it almost goes without saying that Kant would 
totally reject the implications of the all-too-frequently repeated caricatures 
which cast doubt on the sincerity and/or validity of his moral proof.  After 
mentioning the common complaint 'that while in his first Critique [Kant] 
has thrown God out the front door, in the Critique of Practical Reason he let 
Him in again by the back door', Rabel insists:  'There is not a shred of truth 
in this accusation' [RK vii].  Another myth goes back at least as far as 
Heinrich Heine, who claims Kant's revival of God in CPrR (after having 
put Him to death in CPR) is proposed by Kant 'half ironically', only 
because he recognized that 'Old Lampe must have a God' [RPG 119].  
Heine's conjectures reach their height when he suggests that Kant may have 
developed his moral proof 'not merely for the sake of old Lampe, but 
through fear of the police' [276-7]!
	We must admit, with Donald MacKinnon [DMK 133], that 
throughout Kant's treatment of God and religion, he often 'tries to do 
justice to what at a first reading he seems to dismiss out of hand.'  But as 
long as we keep in mind Kant's reliance on the principle of perspective, the 
sincerity and reasonableness of his attempts to do this should be clear 
enough.  Thus, rather than taking Heine's caricature too seriously, we can 
suggest a more appropriate version of Heine's story:  perhaps Kant invented 
the moral argument in order to protect his faithful servant (and all others 
who humbly recognize, with Kant, the universal limits of 'common human 
understanding' [see e.g., CPR xxxii]) from the misuse he knew many 
philosophers would make of his negative criticisms of theoretical arguments 
for God in CPR.  In other words, the moral proof explains not to Lampe 
(who has no need of a formal proof), but to Kant's fellow philosophers--
some of whom may well have joined Kant for lunch, and offered snide 
remarks attacking the servant's simple faith--why Lampe and all other 
human beings have nothing to fear from the limitations of theoretical reason.
8. As Webb puts it in KPR 68, 'Kant...definitely denies that the knowledge 
of God, the Object of religion, falls primarily or properly within the spheres 
of Physics [cf. the judicial system] or Metaphysics [cf. the theoretical 
system].  It is only...to be reached by starting...from the consciousness of 
duty or moral obligation [cf. the practical system].'  Along these lines, Kant 
distinguishes between the moral argument as 'an argument kat' '�nthropon 
valid for all men as rational [i.e., moral] beings in general', and 'the 
theoretical-dogmatic argument kat' alytheian' [PM 306].
9. Peter Byrne argues against Kant's moral proof in KMP 337:  'If 
knowledge of God is impossible then one cannot have grounds for 
believing or thinking that God exists.'  He reaches this conclusion, 
however, only by presupposing an epistemology quite foreign to Kant, 
whereby knowledge is identified with justified belief [336; cf. section 3 of 
RUKT].  For Kant, unknowability by no means implies unthinkability.  
And he distinguishes between knowledge and belief by explaining that the 
evidence for a judgment one believes is true must be 'subjectively 
sufficient', but 'objectively insufficient', whereas the evidence for a 
judgment one knows is true must be 'sufficient both subjectively and 
objectively' [CPR 850].  For Kant, the relevant 'subjective' grounds are, of 
course, moral.
	Oakes argues against the common assumption that anyone who 
believes knowledge of God is possible must reject Kant's doctrine of the 
unknowability of noumena [NPG 31].  He argues that Kant was wrong to 
construe 'all religious epistemology as necessarily a quest for noumenal 
knowing' [32], because our knowledge of God is, in fact, phenomenal 
[33]:  'any sensible experience of God...must be construed as providing 
knowledge which is partial or perspectival, i.e., knowledge solely from the 
vantage point of a finite knower.'  Kant would, of course, agree that all 
knowledge is perspectival, but would argue that our 'sensible experience' is 
never a direct experience of God, in the way that our empirical knowledge is 
a direct experience (i.e., intuition and conception) of empirical objects.  
Rather, the religious person regards some experiences as coming from God 
by means of the God-hypothesis, which can never yield actual knowledge 
of a phenomenon called 'God'.  Nevertheless, Kant's treatment of the 
experience of God is not far removed from that of Oakes, except that Kant 
never regards such experiences as capable of producing knowledge [see 
KCM 67-94].
10. Kant offers the theologian various tools to cope with the realities of 
human ignorance, in the form of analogical models for God's nature which 
represent a balanced and realistic view of some basic theological issues.  
These models, though rarely appreciated by his commentators, constitute an 
important aspect of Kant's systematic understanding of our theoretical 
conception of God's nature, though there will be no opportunity to discuss 
them in this paper.  
11. 'Moral teleology' is the title Kant gives his moral proof in CJ to show 
its structural parallel to teleology proper (i.e., physical teleology).  Each is 
teleological insofar as it concerns the purpose or final end which must be 
posited in order to explain a certain type of experience (viz. of either a moral 
or a physical end).  Beck's criticism of the moral proof on this account 
[CKC 275] is therefore correct, but irrelevant, since this type of teleology is 
clearly distinguishable from that discussed elsewhere in CJ.
12. KNT 64.  Likewise, Goldmann [IK 201] says Kant believes in:  'A 
transcendent superhuman God who has only practical and moral reality but 
who lacks independent moral existence...--a more unreal God could 
scarcely be imagined.'  Such a comment is grossly unfair, however, since 
Kant never dogmatically proclaims that God has no such independent 
existence, but only warns that if He does, we could never grasp it as an item 
of our empirical knowledge.
13. I have discussed this issue in detail in KCM.
14. GWB 1; cf. 42-3.  For instance, Goldmann says 'Kant rejected all 
positive religion' [IK 194].  Or, as J.C. Luik puts it in AKF 345, 'there is 
quite literally no Kantian theology, no religious knowledge for Kant.'  Luik 
makes this assertion in the process of rejecting Wiebe's claim that for Kant 
'"knowledge" of God can be had', though only if it is 'inferred' from 
'moral data' [KNF 531].  Although Luik's position would be correct as a 
description of Kant's theoretical standpoint, it ignores the fact that for Kant 
the practical and judicial standpoints are just as important; for they can each 
produce (at least in a symbolic sense) a kind of knowledge of their own.  
Thus Kant clearly states that 'all our knowledge of God is merely 
symbolic', whereas 'Deism...furnishes no knowledge [of God] 
whatsoever' [CJ 353].
15. LPT 23.  In his 1796 essay, GTLA 391(164-5), Kant makes a similar 
distinction, between Plato's view of 'archetypes (ideas)' as intuitions which 
originate in 'the Divine understanding' but can be 'named directly' by man, 
and his own belief that 'our intuition of these divine ideas...is distributed to 
us but indirectly, as the copies (ectypa)...'
16. Zweig infers from a 1759 letter to Kant that Kant equates 'deism' with 
'sanity' [KPC 35n].  Yet Hamann's letter actually portrays Kant as an 
arbitrator between Hamann the Christian and Berens the deist.  Zweig's 
assumption that Kant was on Berens' side is not justified from the content 
of the letter, which seems instead to portray Kant in his usual, 'critical' 
position as a middle man.
	Although Heine caricaturizes CPR as 'the sword that slew deism in 
Germany' [RPG 268], he believes CPrR was intended to revive it.  
Likewise, Greene regards RLRA as 'a deistic classic' [HCRS lxxvii; see 
also p.lxvi].  And Webb implies that Kant was a deist for most of his life 
when he says that in his Opus Postumum, Kant 'was prepared to repudiate 
...the deism which had been so predominant in his youth--the deism which 
taught a merely transcendent God' [KPR 200-1].  Ironically, Vleeschauwer 
sees in this same work 'a public confession of deism' [DKT 177]!
	There is, however, a growing rank of scholars who reject such 
interpretations.  Despland, for example, argues that in his philosophy of 
religion 'Kant...moved beyond the classical deist position' [KHR 198; see 
also pp.199-201,228,262; and PC 431; KNF 515].  For as Collins puts it:  
'Kant regards religious deism and the varieties of nature-based theism as 
incomplete, preliminary forms of religious life.' [EPR 117].  Indeed, as I 
have demonstrated elsewhere [see DKR and KCM], Kant moves beyond 
these to form a moral theism--one which is thoroughly compatible with his 
Critical principles.  Indeed, Kant's theistic outlook is acknowledged so 
consistently throughout his writings that I would call into question even the 
assumption that Kant ever seriously defended a deistic position as such.
	Kant's rejection of deism is, admittedly, usually expressed in very 
cautious terms--and understandably so, given the dominance of deism in the 
philosophical climate of his day.  Nevertheless, some texts reveal his 
dissatisfaction with deism so clearly that all debate on this question ought to 
be a thing of the past.  In a 1789 letter to Jacobi, for instance, Kant 
approves of his friend's refutation of 'the syncretism of Spinozism and the 
deism of Herder's God' [KPC 158].  And in PFM 356-7, Kant says that if 
theism and anthropomorphism are both abandoned, then 'nothing [would] 
remain but deism, of which nothing can come, which is of no value and 
which cannot serve as any foundation to religion or morals.'
17.  It should be noted, however, that Kant reveals his dissatisfaction with 
the theoretical implications philosophers often impute to theism, by warning 
in CJ 395 that even theism 'is absolutely incapable of authorizing us to 
make any objective assertion.'
