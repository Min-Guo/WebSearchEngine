Facebook is a free site and will never require that you pay to continue using the site. You do, however, have the option of making purchases related to games, apps and other items. In addition, if you choose to use Facebook from your mobile phone, keep in mind that you'll be responsible for any fees associated with internet usage and/or text messaging as determined by your mobile carrier. Learn more about using Facebook on your phone. Permalink · Share · Related articles How helpful did you find this answer? How old do you have to be to sign up for Facebook? To be eligible to sign up for Facebook, you must be at least 13 years old. Permalink · Share · Related articles How helpful did you find this answer? Can I create a joint Facebook account or share a Facebook account with someone else? We don't allow joint accounts. Additionally, you can only sign up for one Facebook account per email address. Since each account belongs to one person, we require everyone to use their authentic name on their account. This way, you always know who you're connecting with. Learn more about our name policies. Permalink · Share · Related articles How helpful did you find this answer? Can I create multiple Facebook accounts? Facebook is a community where people use their authentic identities. It's against the Facebook Community Standards to maintain more than one personal account. If you want to represent your business, organization, brand or product on Facebook, you can use your personal account to create and manage a Page. Keep in mind that a personal profile is for non-commercial use and represents an individual person. Learn more about the differences between Pages and profiles. If you're using your profile to represent something other than yourself, you can convert it to a Page. If you're a public figure, learn about allowing followers. If you have 2 or more accounts, learn how to move your information into a single account. You can also add another name (ex: maiden name, nickname, former name) to your account. Permalink · Share · Related articles How helpful did you find this answer? Why am I getting a Facebook invitation email from a friend? You received this email because a Facebook member is inviting you to join Facebook. Facebook allows people to send invitations to their contacts by entering an email address or by uploading their contacts. If you're already registered for Facebook, your friend may have used an email address of yours that isn't currently linked to your Facebook account. If you'd like, you can add this email address to your existing Facebook account to ensure that you won't get Facebook invitations sent to that address in the future. If you don't have a Facebook account and would like to create one, you can use this email to start the registration process. If you don't want to receive invites from your friends, you can use the unsubscribe link in the footer of the email. Permalink · Share · Related articles How helpful did you find this answer?

Permalink · Share · Related articles How helpful did you find this answer? What is the minimum password strength and how can I make my password strong? When you create a new password, make sure that it's at least 6 characters long. Try to use a complex combination of numbers, letters and punctuation marks. If you see a message letting you know the password you entered isn't strong enough, try mixing together uppercase and lowercase letters or making the password longer. The password you create should be easy for you to remember but hard for someone else to figure out. For extra security, your Facebook password should be different than the passwords you use to log into other accounts, like your email or bank account.
