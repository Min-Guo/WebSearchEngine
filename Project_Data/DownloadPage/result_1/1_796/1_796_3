These songs are all great. Like a good book, you seem to discover something new with every listen. If you enjoyed the Dangerous single, do yourself a favor and buy this right now. It won't disappoint. Comment 15 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback. Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

By LambCHOP6969 on March 27, 2015 Format: Audio CD Verified Purchase "Dangerous" caught my attention, and I've been obsessed since I first heard "Business of Emotion". I would describe this as a perfect album in that I want to listen from beginning to end; every song is so thoroughly amazing that, now having heard them all, I cannot pick one favorite. 1 Comment 10 people found this helpful.

Dawson on March 31, 2015 Format: MP3 Music Verified Purchase this album deserves all the stars. it's fantastic. my favorite track ended up being "Clean". if i could give it 6, i would. just... wow. also, saw them live at a smallish club last week and even without all the "featured artists", it's a great show. i was skeptical, but the album and the show are worth every cent.

Every song is good. Clean and Big Dater are my current favorites. The whole thing gets better each time I listen to it. Comment 9 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?

By Douglas Elick on April 8, 2015 Format: Audio CD I've never written an album review because, well, I suck at it, but I "discovered" an artist that has literally melted my socks into my shoes. You owe it to your ears to listen to "Big Data 2.0" all the way through with good headphones or on a good stereo. I can't fully explain the style, except "Indy Retro Future Synth Pop" or to put it a different way, there's Information Society DNA in here. There are elements of Information Society / Techno Synth Pop, Portishead / Trip-hop, DJ Shadow / Cut style, Skrillex/Dubstep, Depeche Mode / More synth, Arcade Fire / Indy Pop Rock, DeadMau5 / Modern Electro, .... If you like any of the above bands/genres, there's no way you'll come away from the album without at least one full on, "Wrath of Khan" level earwig burrowing into your brain. These are exceptionally well crafted songs in structure, layer, rhythm, chord progressions and detail. Some of these songs are at "Tears for Fears" levels of faultless structure, complexity and lushness. Comment 4 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback...

By Jesse Plaza on July 11, 2015 Format: Vinyl Verified Purchase We're finally getting quality music addressing the evolution of Internet culture! Big Data's first full-length follows satellite radio popularity of singles "Dangerous" and "The Business of Emotion", and covers topics ranging from cleaning up your social media presence to keep up appearances to the Snowden NSA whistleblowing. With multiple electronic-pop-rock styles and a solid list of featured artists, I'm all sorts of hyped for the next from this hip Brooklyn producer. Comment One person found this helpful.

I loved hearing "Dangerous" on the radio and went looking for Big Data and Joywave's music. I loved listening to Big Data's 1.01.0 with 4 songs waiting for the full CD to come out. I instantly loved Big Data's 2.02.0 (full CD that doesn't include 2 of the great songs on 1.0, but you can find them on YouTube). The entire CD is great and mixes well together even though they collaborate with so many different artists on it. My favorites are "Dangerous," "Big Dater" (even though I do prefer the 1.0 version better), "Sick For Me," "Perfect Holiday," "Snowed In," "Clean, and "The Business of Emotion." I highly recommend Big Data and Joywave too! If you like Big Data, you'll love Joywave and will want to get his Koda VistaKoda Vista by Joywave [Music CD] which contains 7 great songs (2 are just music), along with his awesome CD How Do You Feel Now?How Do You Feel Now? and his single "Ridge"Ridge.

Turn It Up!! By KP Jandt on November 22, 2015 Format: Audio CD Verified Purchase This is one of them CDs you have to play LOUD!! I love Dangerous, Clean, and Big Dater! I do enjoy the entire CD. It is rare I enjoy new music ( new to me ) as much as I like Big Data. I can listen to the CD again and again never tire of the music. I love it when a CD comes out that I turn up the volume loud enough for the County Sheriff to visit!! Comment Was this review helpful to you? Yes No Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback.
