Man, I'm glad I got out when I did. #Gottadoyou — Kris Humphries (@KrisHumphries) April 25, 2015 Though he later clarified his remarks (after the scrutiny had reached fever pitch, of course), Jenner chose to stay in the love and light, ignoring the comments entirely… until now. Related: Artist Turns Death Threats Against Caitlyn Jenner Into Beautiful Artwork On the upcoming fourth installment of I am Cait (which will feature Caitlyn’s first on-camera sit-down with ex-wife Kris Jenner), Caitlyn sits down with former honorary son-in-law Scott Disick to chat about her journey. “What do you think from a guy’s perspective?” Caitlyn asks Scott. “I don’t know if every man in the world is going to be as comfortable as I am,” he admits. “Kind of like the Kris Humphries?” Caitlyn asks. “Did you hear what he said after the Diane Sawyer piece? Kris Idiot Humprhies Tweets ’Thank God I got out of that family on time’ and just got absolutely ripped to where four hours later he had to make an apology. I’ve got too many friends, too many things to do, I don’t need haters in my life.” Check out the clip below. h/t: EW Evan Ross Katz Tags: Caitlyn Jenner View related posts around the web Powered By Zergnet ZergNet NewNowNext about archive FOLLOW LOGOTV LOGO LINKS About Logo Contact Us Channel Locator Events & Sweepstakes Press Advertising Info Privacy Policy NEW [Updated 2/9/2016] Terms of Use NEW [Updated 2/9/2016] Closed Captioning Copyright Compliance Ad Choices © 2016 Viacom International Inc.
