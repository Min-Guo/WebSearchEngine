We know you are too, and it’s downright cruel to make you wait eight more days to get your Barbershop fix. So, here’s a present wrapped in a big, Nicki Minaj-patterned bow: Snapchats from the Los Angeles premiere of the film. Yaaas! VH1 took over the Barbershop red carpet earlier this week and mingled with the faces of the flick. We’re happy to report they’re just as gorgeous in person…and funny as hell! Check out some of the best moments from the red carpet in the gallery below. 1 Anthony Anderson served some serious face. VH1 2 The whole cast in their glam AF natural state. VH1 3 Ice Cube = suit goals. VH1 4 Deon Cole’s stare is known to cause fainting, you know. VH1 5 Lamorne Morris gave us sexy nerd realness all night. VH1 6 The Cube up close and personal.
