Arts. Online. From PBS. About PBS Arts Off Book Idea Channel Archive 25th Mar 2016 | 272 notes pbsdigitalstudios: theartassignment: New video! You’ve probably seen a few cubes sitting in an art gallery and questioned why they were there. Why are machine-made cubes in an art gallery? How did we get here? This is the case for Minimalism. “With Minimalism, meaning doesn’t rest inside the object, waiting to be unlocked. The meaning is in the context and exists in your interaction with it.” Give it a chance.  19th Feb 2016 | 195 notes benrogerswpg: Photography, Day Dream, Hengki Lee http://bit.ly/VCAcbX (via issafly) 19th Feb 2016 | 54 notes Happy Birthday Yoko!  28th Jan 2016 | 646 notes (Source: piur, via topherchris) 28th Jan 2016 | 1,161 notes hitrecord: “Umbrellas…” 2nd Dec 2015 | 1,963 notes nevver: Winter is coming, Mitsuharu Maeda (via yama-bato) 12th Nov 2015 | 1,049 notes theartassignment: New video! This week we’re talking about a group of supremely awesome and unapologetic artists who take risks, question art world practices, and also happen to be women – we’re calling them Fierce Women of Art. These are truly inspirational artists who make a wide range of work, and today we’re going to single out and celebrate five of them: the Guerrilla Girls, Corita Kent, Lynda Benglis, Xiao Lu, and Kara Walker. 4th Aug 2015 | 217 notes theartassignment: atkalelza: The Art Assignment: Surface Test - Kim Beck I decided to do the rubbing on the sidewalk - the place I see almost every day from my window. It’s old and cracked and I still remember my childhood summers walking barefoot, feeling the heat and cutting weeds from the cracks as I earned my first allowance.  Although today day was windy I could still feel warmth of the ground as I tried to capture the surface. I used a graphite stick on some old paper lying under my bed for years. At the beginning the graphite was so light that I barely even saw the texture. Halfway through my graphite was too small to draw anything. Finally I decided to use my whole palm and that was when the magic happened! A really lovely Surface Test! Love the use of the hands. Perhaps feet would have been more appropriate? ;).  4th Aug 2015 | 645 notes iamjapanese: Chantale Delrue（Flemish/Australian） Dark Evening with Tiger Moth   via 3rd Aug 2015 | 1,072 notes (Source: jessedraxler.com, via zeroing) 1 2 3 4 5 Older The Minimalist Theme designed by The Minimalist | Powered by Tumblr $(".photoset").each(function() { var newSrc = $(this).attr("src").replace('500','830'); $(this).attr("src", newSrc); });
