In Okaloosa and Walton communities, just pick up your home phone, office phone, or cell phone and dial 2-1-1. What if I have problems dialing 211? For organizations with in-house phone networks, or PBX telephone systems, calling parameters may need to be adjusted to enable three-digit dialing access to 2-1-1. Most systems will allow dialing access to 911, but modifications may be required to permit 2-1-1 calling. Typically, your telecommunications staff or a service provider can make this simple adjustment. In some cases, the issue can be resolved by dialing 9 or another access code needed to get an outside line before dialing 2-1-1. You can call 211 directly by dialing 850-892-4357.
