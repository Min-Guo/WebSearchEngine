Skip to main content Giving Connect Directory Search: Admissions Academics Campus Life Research Alumni Global About About About The seal of Georgetown University. It bears the founding date, 1789, the university motto "Utraque Unum" (both into one) and the Latin inscription Collegium Georgiopolitanum Ad Ripas Potomaci in Marylandia, which means "Georgetown College on the Banks of the Potomac in Maryland." Georgetown University is one of the world’s leading academic and research institutions, offering a unique educational experience that prepares the next generation of global citizens to lead and make a difference in the world. We are a vibrant community of exceptional students, faculty, alumni and professionals dedicated to real-world applications of our research, scholarship, faith and service. Established in 1789, Georgetown is the nation’s oldest Catholic and Jesuit university. Drawing upon the 450-year-old legacy of Jesuit education, we provide students with a world-class learning experience focused on educating the whole person through exposure to different faiths, cultures and beliefs. Students are challenged to engage in the world and become men and women in the service of others, especially the most vulnerable and disadvantaged members of the community. These values are at the core of Georgetown’s identity, binding members of the community across diverse backgrounds. Obama Salutes Georgetown Leadership on University Charter Anniversary March 1, 2015 The President of the United States and senior congressional members pay tribute to the university’s 200th anniversary of its charter, signed into law on March 1, 1815.
