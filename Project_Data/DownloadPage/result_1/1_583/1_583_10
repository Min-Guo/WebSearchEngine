Twin Shadow) Big Data 3:55 $1.29 View In iTunes 10 Songs Editors’ Notes Sure, 2.0 is packed with ultra-hip A-list cameos—everyone from electro-soul futurist Jamie Lidell to Wye Oak vocalist Jenn Wasner shows up to sing—but the pixelated pop that fills Big Data’s first proper full-length album gets its euphoric continuity from the singular touch of Brooklyn-based producer/mastermind Alan Wilkis. Wilkis brings crunchy synths and soaring melodies to each of the album’s tracks, switching between funky, ‘80s electro-funk grooves (“Dangerous”) and full-on synth-rock rangers (“Get Some Freedom”). The story of infamous NSA contractor Edward Snowden inspires the shimmering electro-pop of “Snowed In” (which features a guest vocal by Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo), while “The Glow” is a sassy anthem aided by colorful New Zealand vocalist Kimbra. Big Data was selected as a part of our 2015 New Artist Spotlight. Customer Reviews Wow       by Skye Chase I found "dangerous" in the summer and I loved it. I clicked this album hoping for the same sort of vibe and I found something better. Great Album Bro       by Phan7om1717 Owning and listening to the other songs already available, I can see this album is going to be great. My favorite song is Business of Emotion. GOOD STUFF       by SonicPillow Having a really hard time finding songs on this album that I don't like. Big Data better go places with this album or I'm suing the music industry as a whole. Biography Formed: 2012 in New York, NY [Brooklyn] Genre: Alternative Years Active: '10s Big Data is the contemporary electropop project of Brooklyn-based producer and Harvard graduate Alan Wilkis, inspired by themes of humans vs. technology. Vocalist Daniel Armbruster, Rajeev Basu ("interactive/hacker"), and GHOST+COW ("visual") have also been credited with early input. During the tail end of the 2000s and the beginning of the 2010s, Wilkis established himself as a remix producer for the likes of Temper Trap ("Sweet Disposition"), Fenech-Soler ("Demons"), and Yelle ("Que Veux-Tu") --...
