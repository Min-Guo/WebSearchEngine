NFL NBA CFB MLB Soccer UFC NHL WWE Golf NASCAR CBB More Trending Lab Lists Video Tickets College Basketball Lepanto to Kentucky Wildcats: Malik Monk Has Derrick Rose-Type Athleticism By BR Studios , Featured Columnist Mar 29, 2016 Share Tweet Next ARTICLE » Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories Share Tweet 62.6K Reads 45 Comments Five-star guard Malik Monk is one of the most interesting high school basketball players in the country. Not only because of his absurd athleticism, but also because of his roots. Monk was born and raised in the tiny town of Lepanto, Arkansas, which has a population of 1,893.  His community within Lepanto, referred to as "The Woods," has molded his game into something of pure beauty, and all he wants is to make his hometown proud. Bleacher Report traveled down to Lepanto to see where it all began and how The Woods molded him into who he is today. Watch the video to find out why he will be the next great Kentucky Wildcat.   Note: Russell Westbrook and Dwyane Wade vertical jumps taken from personal NBA combine results.
