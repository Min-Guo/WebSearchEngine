WHITE SEA)" Donâ€™t forget, this Saturday is Record Store Day! Snag one of the limited copies of the Big Data x RAC Fair Trade EP on an exclusive, 7" colored vinyl at your local record store. You can find your store here.Â  April 13th, 2016 at 3:57 PM 2 Notes A few months ago, we had the incredible honor of working with Universal Audio and the legendary Mick Guzauski on this insanely fun project. For those that donâ€™t know, UA is pretty much my favorite company for all things recording-related. I say this without exaggeration - every single piece of music that Iâ€™ve made over the last several years has been touched by UA in some way or other. And as for Mick, wellâ€¦ just take a look at his resume.Â  The gyst of the project was to come to UAâ€™s headquarters in Santa Cruz, CA and write and record a new piece of music in their amazing Studio 610, all engineered and mixed by Mick, using only UAâ€™s interface and plugins. We felt like kids in a candy store the whole week, getting to see how and where the magic is made at UA, and getting to know some of the many wonderful faces behind some of my absolute favorite gear. Check it out! March 29th, 2016 at 4:26 PM 1 Notes DJ Set Before Weezer at Warsaw, March 30th Brooklyn! Doing a DJ set before Weezerâ€™s show at the Warsaw next Wednesday.
