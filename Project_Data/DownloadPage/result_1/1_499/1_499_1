The duet came after Perry presented Parton, 70, with the Tex Ritter Award for her TV biopic, Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors, which aired on NBC last year to rave reviews and overwhelming commercial success. “I recently tweeted that I was but just one tiny sequin on Dolly Parton’s gown,” Perry gushed. “I think I’ll say, though, maybe we’re kind of cut from the same lamé because her grandpa was a preacher, my father’s a preacher; we both grew up singin’ and playin’ guitar in church; and we’re both know for some of the biggest…songs in our fields,” added the equally well-endowed singer, with a wink toward Parton. Parton joined Perry on the stage and gave a heartwarming speech of her own, thanking the Academy for the award and reflecting on the film’s importance to her life.     As she wrapped up, the two came together to perform the spirited medley, which included “Jolene,” “Coat of Many Colors,” and “9 to 5.” Though it was the first time the duo had ever performed together, their chemistry was visible.   Cody Gohl Tags: Katy Perry, Dolly Parton View related posts around the web Powered By Zergnet ZergNet NewNowNext about archive FOLLOW LOGOTV LOGO LINKS About Logo Contact Us Channel Locator Events & Sweepstakes Press Advertising Info Privacy Policy NEW [Updated 2/9/2016] Terms of Use NEW [Updated 2/9/2016] Closed Captioning Copyright Compliance Ad Choices © 2016 Viacom International Inc.
