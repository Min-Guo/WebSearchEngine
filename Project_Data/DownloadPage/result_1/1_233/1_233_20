Florida Board of Optometry Search Posts, Pages & FAQs: FAQs Contact Sitemap Friday, April 15th, 2016 Home Licensing Renewals Resources Meetings The Board Does your CE/CME Provider report Course Completions? Posted in Latest News on April 4, 2014. The Florida Department of Health will now verify licensee compliance with continuing education requirements at the time of licensure renewal. Licensees must report continuing education course completion to the electronic tracking system, powered by CE Broker, before license renewal. The Department has partnered with CE/CME providers in an effort to eliminate the need for licensees to self-report course completion. There are currently over 3000 CE/CME providers reporting course information to CE Broker. If you see this logo on your CE/CME provider’s website or course materials, it will not be necessary for you to self-report course completion. This logo signifies that the CE/CME provider will report course completion on your behalf. ← Previous Post Next Post → More Latest News ANNOUNCEMENT: MQA Online Services February 25, 2016 Services will be unavailable on Saturday, March 5, 2016 from 9 AM to 4 PM Eastern Standard Time for system upgrades.
