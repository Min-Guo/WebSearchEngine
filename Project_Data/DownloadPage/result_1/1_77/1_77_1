JD Shelburne About JD Shelburne In the last few years, JD Shelburne has become one of Kentucky’s fastest rising stars, with album credits, countless shows, a loyal fan base, charity work that has raised thousands of dollars and a list full of accolades that sets Shelburne apart from the rest. Country Artist JD Shelburne grew up on a tobacco farm in Taylorsville, KY, a tiny town southeast of the Ohio River near Louisville KY. At age 19, he found a guitar after the death of his grandmother and began learning to play and sing on his own. By his sophomore year of college, he had found a few gigs at some local bars in the Louisville, KY and Lexington, KY area and developed a fan-base that eventually landed him on some of the biggest stages in the business, opening for some of the nation’s hottest stars. Eventually, Shelburne was adding original songs into the set mix, in addition to producing songs of his own material. In 2002, Kentucky fell in love at first sight with Shelburne, then college student/ small-town country boy with a wide smile, natural singing voice and a love of faith, family and his hometown of Taylorsville, KY. But that small-town image is merely a fond memory now that he has moved on to Nashville down the path to music stardom. Now find him soaking up the music scene, touring cities, building a fan-base and celebrating a decade of success playing venues all across the southeast trying to get his big break. Today he’s among the most hard working and relevant country singers in the business. They say Nashville doesn’t work that way anymore – that talented musicians with very few connections don’t stand a chance. But J.D. Shelburne proved that Music City’s engine still runs off of talent and persistent driven antics. Critics find him credible. Fans pack his shows. Venues strive to book him. There are very few new artists recording songs today about whom that can be said. During his whirlwind career explosion, he has performed with over 50 national acts ranging from stars such as Montgomery Gentry, Jamey Johnson, Kellie Pickler, Steve Wariner to Clay Walker and Johnny Lee, performed at some of the region’s most famous venues such as Rupp Arena, Murphy Center, KFC Yum Center, Freedom Hall, Churchill Downs and Old Cardinal Stadium which drew the Kentucky State Fair’s largest crowd of the 2013 year. He has also been featured in Country Weekly Magazine, Kentucky Alumni Magazine, Kentucky Monthly Magazine amongst many other national publications including the Huffington Post. His debut music video “Farmboy” gained him thousands of new fans by airing on the TNN Top Ten Countdown nationwide on Heartland TV network and ZUUS Country Network. Most recently he made his Nationwide debut on GAC – Great American Country Network and also CMT.com in October 2015 with his 2nd music video entitled “Hometown” written about the demise of his smalltown. On October 21, 2015, Shelburne was the #1 trending artist on CMT.com beating out Taylor Swift, Luke Bryan and Jason Aldean! Shelburne has performed over 1000 concerts all over the southeast as well as over 500 festivals. Shelburne’s outfit is also featured on display at the Kentucky Derby Museum at Historic Churchill Downs from his appearance at the 2015 Kentucky Derby. Shelburne was also invited to perform at several prestigious nationwide events such as: 2 NBA Basketball Games, The Kentucky Derby, Unbridled Eve Derby Gala, Minor League Baseball Games, Dollar General NASCAR Racing Team Event, CMA Music Festival, the NCAA Women’s Final Four, SEC Men’s Basketball Tournament, NCAA Division 1 College Basketball Games and more! Shelburne, a native of Taylorsville, Kentucky grew up on mixture of country, church gospel and pop rock music forging his own sound along the way.
