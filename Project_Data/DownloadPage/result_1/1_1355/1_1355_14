Boston’s reserves ultimately proved themselves to be the superior group. Boston and Milwaukee were separated by just one point after three quarters of play. That’s when the cream of the crop rose when it came to reserve play. Gigi Datome and Kelly Olynyk led the C’s during the fourth quarter by combining for 22 points. Datome scored 12 of those points, while Olynyk contributed 10. Boston shot 57.1 percent from the field during the fourth quarter and at one point pulled ahead by nine points. None of Boston’s regular starters appeared during the fourth quarter while the reserves claimed a 105-100 victory. Key Player Gigi got the start. And Gigi took advantage. One of Boston’s fan favorites, Gigi Datome, appeared in the starting lineup for the first time in his NBA career Wednesday night in Milwaukee. He made it count by torching the nets with his red-hot shooting. Datome blew his previous career high in the scoring column out of the water by dropping 22 points on Milwaukee. He shot nine-of-15 from the field and made more field goals than any other player in the game. Datome’s previous career high was just 13 points. The Celtics didn’t get much else from Datome – three rebounds, two assists and a blocked shot – but they didn’t need much else. His hot shooting was just enough to power Boston to its sixth straight win. Box Score Nuggets Gigi Datome set a new career high with 22 points. His previous career high was 13. Each team dished out at least 35 assists on the night. Boston shot an impressive 13-of-30 (43.3 percent) from 3-point range. Neither team shot better than 68.8 percent from the free-throw line. Johnny O'Bryant's nine rebounds were a game high. Evan Turner and Michael Carter-Williams each picked up a technical foul. There were 11 lead changes and 11 ties in the game. Kelly Olynyk and Jonas Jerebko each scored 16 points off of Boston's bench. Ersan Ilyasova led Milwaukee with 21 points. Each team's largest lead of the night was nine points. Jared Sullinger blocked a game-high three shots. Phil Pressey led the Celtics with seven assists. James Young scored nine points in 24-plus minutes of action. Quote of the Night We gained some steam heading into playoff time. Hopefully we can hold on to that.
