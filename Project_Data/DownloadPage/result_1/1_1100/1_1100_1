Published on Feb 14, 2016 The Zika Virus and West Nile Virus have made people more concerned about mosquitos now than in the past. Mosquitos have become deadly threats, not just unpleasant pests. One of the best ways to comabt mosquitos is to make your own mosquito fan traps. if you already have a box fan the trap only costs a few dollars to make. It will cost less than a couple of dollars a moth in electricity to operate. As a reminder to viewers I go over in this video the two fan trap designs I have posted in earlier videos. In the latter part of the video I catalog the most common places mosquitos breed in the home and neighborhood so people can be pro active in eliminating them and also provide some ways to combat mosqitoes that not everyone may be aware of. If you are interested in purchasing the food tents to make your own mosquito traps, I provide an amazon link below and also links to the most popualr and effective larvicides that are non toxic, safe and readily available. thanks for watching.
