The purpose of organizing an "Astronomy and Astrophysics Schoolhow to write scientific papers for different forums (journals, proceedings, thesis manuscripts, etc.). Each morning and afternoon session will contain at least three lectures. Every lecture will be followed by an open discussion session, where students can address any issues related to the topics treated in the lectures. A daily discussion session "students only" will be organised, and the students will be given ample opportunity to raise questions emanating from these sessions. All lecturers have long professional experience in publishing, editorial matters, scientific writing and library and database management. Students can also bring manuscripts and drafts of papers and seek advice, or present their own research in poster format. Posters will not be included in the Proceedings book.
