  Introduction to the HTML Edition John Veitch Translation of 1901 Original Latin Text of 1641 Duc de Luynes French Translation of 1647         July 27, 2005     Descartes' Meditations Introduction to the HTML Edition The publication of this English-Latin-French HTML edition of DesCartes' Meditations on First Philosophy is quite simply an experiment in electronic scholarship. We decided to make this edition available and to encourage its free distribution for scholarly purposes. The idea behind the experiment is to see how others involved in electronic scholarship might put these texts to use. We have no pre-determined ideas of what such use may be when transformed from this origin. The texts have no hypertext annotations except for those used for navigation. We invite others to download this edition and to create their own hypertext annotated editions and then to publish those additions on their own Web servers for everyone to use. The texts used in this edition are: The original Latin edition of 1641 The Duc de Luynes French translation of 1647 The John Veitch English translation of 1901 Each paragraph has been numbered using the paragraph divisions of the original Latin text. Since page numbers are no longer useful for citations in electronic texts, paragraph numbering seemed the best solution. This edition may not be sold in either electronic or print format without permission from the editors. Please send comments about this project to: Charles S. Taylor �1996 by David B.
