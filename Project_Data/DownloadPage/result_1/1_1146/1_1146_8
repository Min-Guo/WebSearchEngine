Web SiteBest Buy SupportApplication License Agreement What's New in Version 9.10.1 - Bug Fixes Screenshots iPhone iPad Customer Reviews Hassle and a half...next please       by Jsnrdrck 2 things... 1. Best Buy's high security password requirements are ridiculous. Having to set a phrase or sentence as your password is too much of a hassle. There's no need for such high security. 2. Why can I not add my rewards card to Apple Wallet/Passbook!? Having to open up the app and and remember my high security password, and then having to reset it when I can't remember it, is too much of a pain when I just want to access my rewards card. 3. And to add a third, the UI isn't very user friendly. Great but still missing a key feature       by Tiger1974 I use this app for research and my rewards card, but not letting you import you reward card into passbook makes it more difficult to use at times. Thank you       by Vlad12 32 out of the last 35 updates have been "bug fixes" and the app is still buggy. I can't simply filter the weekly ad on my iPhone 6. That's the only thing I want to use this app for, which means it's useless to me. And with the latest update the app takes 20 seconds to load, then switches me to my settings app. Round of applause.
