country code: \US Get the CMT Artists App and discover music wherever you are. Chris Young About Chris Young At the age of 29, Chris Young, “one of country music’s most reliable hitmakers” (USA Today) has accomplished more than some artists do in a lifetime. Already a Grammy-nominated recording artist, he’s also a dynamic live performer, being declared “commanding and confident” (Houston Chronicle) and “a headliner in his own right” (Times-Leader). With four albums to his credit, Young plays a powerhouse show packed with hits, including chart toppers “Gettin’ You Home,” “The Man I Want To Be,” “Voices,” “Tomorrow,” “You” and “Who I Am With You.” He’s amassed six #1 singles, seven Gold/Platinum certifications and performed for audiences ranging from ABC’s “Good Morning America” to Australia and Dublin to “The Late Show with David Letterman.” The RCA Records artist is an international ambassador for his genre, a talented songwriter, and a handsome charmer to boot who is frequently declared one of country music’s sexiest men by People and Country Weekly magazines. With the release of his most recent record, “I’m Comin’ Over” from his highly anticipated fifth studio album, Young is just as well known for his classic baritone as he is for melt-your-heart ballads and is winning audiences across the globe.
