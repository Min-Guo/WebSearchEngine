All selected applicants are required to complete Section 1 of federal Form I-9 (Employment Eligibility Verification) and to provide identification and either proof of U.S. citizenship or proof of authorization to work in the U.S. In addition, State Personnel System agencies use E-Verify as part of the I-9 process to verify the work eligibility of all new hires. E-Verify is an Internet-based system that compares information from an employee's Form I-9 to data from U.S Department of Homeland Security and Social Security Administration records. The official U.S. E-Verify Participation Posters informing State Personnel System current and prospective employees of their legal rights and protections are available below: E-Verify Participation Poster - English ( 241.02 KB) Right to Work Poster - English  ( 190.59 KB)     E-Verify Participation Poster - Spanish  ( 247.70 KB) Right to Work Poster - Spanish ( 239.08 KB) Additionally, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) web site provides answers to many questions about E-Verify asked by employers and employees.
