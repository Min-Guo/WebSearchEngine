By using the website and its related services, products, and software (collectively, the "Site") you agree to be bound by these terms ("Conditions of Use"). You also accept the Conditions of Use when you create an account, sign in as guest, or log in to the site.

You may not use the Site if you are under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Site only with involvement of a parent or guardian. Privacy Your use of the Site is subject to our Privacy Policy. Please review the policy for more on how we collect and use information. Errors on Our Site We try to be as accurate as possible. However, we do not warrant that product descriptions or other Site content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. Prices and promotions are subject to change, and may vary from those offered in our stores. We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, rarely an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we may contact you for instructions on the order. Paying for Your Order Generally, we'll charge your card for an item when we ship the item to you or confirm its availability in-store. However, we may pre-authorize your order amount with your credit or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When you preorder with a debit card, we'll debit your card when you place the preorder. For special delivery items, we'll charge your card when you confirm a delivery time. For digital items, we'll charge your card when you initiate the download of the product or the product is placed in your account and available for use. Order Confirmation Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the e-mail address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of an order that we've already charged you for, we'll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.
