This type of practical learning environment sets our students apart as they explore the frontiers of microbiological science in a fun and engaging classroom setting. Read more » Undergraduate research is a student-faculty collaboration Professor, graduate and undergraduate students in the Burand lab collaborate on research which enables each student to explore a project of interest to them and later communicate the results to others at the departmental, university-wide and national stage. Read more » Undergraduate Program Overview The Department of Microbiology offers undergraduates both a major and minor in microbiology. We also offer a Fifth Year Master's Program exclusively for our microbiology majors. You can get additional information about our program or the University by visiting the on-line version of the Guide to Undergraduate Programs. Microbiology Major The curriculum for students majoring in microbiology includes a broad background and education in the sciences, including chemistry, biology, physics, and mathematics as well as specific, focused training in the field of microbiology. Majors complete 27 credits in microbiology departmental courses, with offerings in general microbiology, molecular and microbial genetics, immunology, virology, microbial physiology, pathogenic bacteriology, biotechnology and microbial ecology. For more information, see specific requirements for a major in microbiology. In addition to coursework, students are strongly encouraged to participate in independent research projects with individual faculty members. Students also obtain valuable experience by participating in summer internship and co-operative education programs. Microbiology Minor A minor in microbiology is available to undergraduates and requires completion of 15 credits in microbiology in courses numbered higher than 300. Students must include MICBIO 310 - General Microbiology and MICBIO 265 - Intro to Microbiology Lab in those 15 credits. Anyone interested in completing a minor should meet with a faculty advisor to plan their program. Departmental Honors A Departmental Honors Track is available in Microbiology and requires an overall cumulative grade point average of 3.4 and at least sophomore standing in Commonwealth College. Application to the program is made through an interview with the Departmental Honors Coordinator. Upon admission to the program, the Honors Coordinator will assist the student in finding a research sponsor from among the faculty. For more information on the Departmental Honors Track, see the required course work listing.
