country code: \US Get the CMT Artists App and discover music wherever you are. Chris Stapleton About Chris Stapleton The raw power of Chris Stapleton's voice grabs you the moment he starts to sing. The award winning singer/songwriter has been described by some of today's most credible artists, including Adele, Sheryl Crow, Luke Bryan and Vince Gill, as the best voice in Nashville, and that whiskey-soaked sound with its punch-you-in-the-gut soul, is the standout focus of his first studio album for Mercury Records. A native of the small town of Staffordsville, KY (pop: 2400) and son of a coal miner, Stapleton made the move to Nashville in 2001 to learn the craft of songwriting and pursue a career in music. A decade later, he has scored four #1 country hits with songs penned for George Strait, Kenny Chesney, Darius Rucker and Josh Turner, and has racked up over 170 album cuts for artists including Tim McGraw, Brad Paisley and Alan Jackson. With a wide variety of personal influences ranging from traditional country and bluegrass to rock and roll and blues, Stapleton has had a diverse singing career since his arrival in Nashville that includes stints as lead vocalist for GRAMMY nominated bluegrass band The SteelDrivers and lead vocalist in the howling rock and roll band The Jompson Brothers. In Stapleton's own words he describes "my life has been one tucked neatly in the liner notes of other people's albums as a writer, musician or band member…until now." The lead single "What Are You Listening To” off his debut Mercury Records album was produced by Tony Brown and will hit radio July 1.
