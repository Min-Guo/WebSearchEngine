Solar State by State Click on the states below for more detailed information SEIA Action State SEIA Featured State State Policy Priorities 1. Access to net metering and best practice rate design for distributed generation customers. 2. Inclusion of solar heating and cooling (SHC) to in state Renewable Portfolio Standards (“RPSs”). 3. Reduce soft costs - promote best practice interconnection and model permitting rules. 4. Maintain and improve cost-effective incentive programs, including tax credits/exemptions, rebates, and performance-based incentives. 5. Maintain and expand renewable portfolio standards or their equivalents, specifically DG and solar carve outs. Pursue recognition for solar’s capacity value and other grid/market benefit. 6. Increase investment vehicles and reduce risk- encourage long term financing and contracts for renewables; promote third party financing and power purchase agreements (between customers/developers and developers/utilities).
