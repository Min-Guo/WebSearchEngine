Johnnyswim | New Music And Songs |

country code: \US Get the MTV Artists App and discover music wherever you are. Johnnyswim About Johnnyswim Johnnyswim is a compelling amalgam of soul, folk, pop and blues rooted in the eclectic enclaves of Nashville, Los Angeles, and New York City. Like melody is to harmony, the voices of Abner Ramirez and Amanda Sudano Ramirez are uniquely symbiotic. The singer/songwriters hail from Los Angeles, California and spend most of their time writing, recording and performing their tunes. If they’re not doing that, the self-proclaimed “foodies” can probably be found eating too much. They are the stylistic cousin to Lauryn Hill, John Legend, and Corinne Bailey Rae, yet wholly original and distinct from any other artist or band. In addition to touring, songwriting and recording, Johnnyswim remains highly involved in not for profit efforts around the globe and at home, all of which are aimed at bringing hope and inspiration to places that often don’t get enough of it.
