Collaborate, Innovate, Discover The Future of Chemistry Begins Here   To the young scientist just embarking on an independent career, the Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois offers a wide range of programs.  From single disciplinary to multi-disciplinary, you will find innovative and exciting research options in chemical biology and in analytical, inorganic, materials, organic, physical and theoretical chemistry. Faculty and students in our laboratories also benefit from our close relationships with other departments on campus, including Biochemistry, Materials Science, Physics, and Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering, as well as the Beckman Institute, the Materials Research Laboratory, and the Institute for Genomic Biology. The Department of Chemistry has served as a focal point for inter-disciplinary research on campus for over 100 years. Discover a new anti-cancer drug, develop a self-healing polymer, or study the chemistry in inter-stellar space. These are just a few of the opportunities available at Illinois where we have a tradition of innovative thinking since 1868.   The American Chemical Society, in a review of various programs, has called the School of Chemical Sciences at Illinois "a major force in chemical education" in the U.S., and national rankings of chemistry departments nationwide consistently put Illinois near the top among a select group. As a graduate student at Illinois you will experience the thrill of working on the most challenging problems in the molecular sciences.   Research Areas Analytical Chemistry Chemical Biology Chemical Physics General Chemistry Inorganic Chemistry Materials Chemistry Organic Chemistry Physical Chemistry Theoretical Chemistry     Chemistry About Faculty Research Graduate Program Undergraduate Program Giving Alumni Community Public Engagement News Events Research Analytical Chemistry Chemical Biology Chemical Physics General Chemistry Inorganic Chemistry Materials Chemistry Organic Chemistry Physical Chemistry Theoretical Chemistry Copyright 2011, The Department of Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 505 South Mathews Avenue Urbana, IL 61801 / (217)333-5071 / Fax: (217)244-7091 For questions regarding this website, contact chem-webmaster@illinois.edu.
