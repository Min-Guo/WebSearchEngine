The Environmental Health Sections extends every effort to protect you and your family from the harmful effects of waste, disease vectors, safety hazards, natural disasters and contaminated air, food and water. This is done through extensive and continued surveillance, along with investigation and mitigation of environmental conditions where disease transfer is possible or suspected. The Environmental Health Division monitors “health” of the environment, so residents and visitors can experience optimum health now and in generations to come. Environmental Health Specialists utilize their education and training in the natural, physical, and environmental sciences to promote public health through outreach and control of environmental factors. The Environmental Health division is responsible for conducting inspections, issuing permits and licenses, enforcing statutes and codes, and for responding to questions regarding environmental concerns.            eBridge Solutions eBridge Solutions is a web-based records storage system.
