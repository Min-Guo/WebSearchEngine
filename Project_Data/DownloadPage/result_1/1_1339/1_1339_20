Kim2 1 Emirates Aviation College, Aeronautical Engineering Department, 53044, Dubai, UAE 2 Emirates Aviation College, Faculty of Aerodynamics, Aeronautical Engineering Department, 53044, Dubai, UAE a Corresponding author: hmd1988@gmail.com Published online: 25 March 2014 Abstract This study presents computational results of a NACA0012 base wing with the trailing edge modified to incorporate triangular serrations. The effect of the serrations were investigated in three stages, the deflection angle of the serration with respect to the wing chord were examined from -90° to 90° at 10° intervals; the results obtained showed that although larger deflection induces a stronger vorticity magnitude, the strength of the vortex decays faster than compared to smaller deflections. Moreover, the vorticity profile downstream of the wing varies with deflection angle of the serration. Next, the addition of a Clark Y flap to the base wing to analyze the flow pattern and the effect on the flow separation; without serrations attached to the base wing trailing edge, at a high angle of attack, the flow will separate early and would render the flap less effective. The Vortex generator energizes the boundary layer and encourages the flow to remain attached to the flap, allowing for a greater range flap deflection. A wind tunnel experiment was developed and conducted to substantiate the computational analysis in a real world scenario. There was a positive correlation between the results obtained experimentally and computationally. © Owned by the authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2014 What is OpenURL? The OpenURL standard is a protocol for transmission of metadata describing the resource that you wish to access. An OpenURL link contains article metadata and directs it to the OpenURL server of your choice. The OpenURL server can provide access to the resource and also offer complementary services (specific search engine, export of references...). The OpenURL link can be generated by different means. If your librarian has set up your subscription with an OpenURL resolver, OpenURL links appear automatically on the abstract pages. You can define your own OpenURL resolver with your EDPS Account. In this case your choice will be given priority over that of your library. You can use an add-on for your browser (Firefox or I.E.) to display OpenURL links on a page (see http://www.openly.com/openurlref/). You should disable this module if you wish to use the OpenURL server that you or your library have defined. EDP Sciences Mentions légales Contacts
