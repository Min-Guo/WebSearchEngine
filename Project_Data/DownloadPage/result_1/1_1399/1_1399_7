This year’s theme, “Building Healthy Communities: Accelerating Health Equity throughout Florida,” reflects our continuous and collective efforts to increase momentum toward becoming a state where all Floridians achieve the highest level of health possible. This observance serves as a reminder of the progress made and the commitment to improve health for minority communities. “Florida is committed to improving the health of all residents through our programs, partnerships and county health departments,” said Interim State Surgeon General Dr. Celeste Philip. “Using data, we will continue to raise awareness about communities with large numbers of racial and ethnic minority members most challenged by health inequities. By addressing social determinants of health through strategic and innovative partnerships in these communities, we will continue to make progress toward achieving health equity for all Floridians.” Click here to learn more about what we do in Florida every day...
