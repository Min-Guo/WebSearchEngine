Environmental policy analysis is the analysis of economic, scientific, and other data to provide objective information on environmental issues. The end goals are to create policy recommendations, promote solutions, and build public awareness. What Does an Environmental Policy Analyst Do? An environmental policy analyst researches the data, relationships, and policy developments surrounding environmental challenges and proposed solutions. Their analyses, which usually involve advanced statistical techniques and analytical models, lead to recommendations for legislation, awareness campaigns, or fundraising approaches. Some environmental policy analysts focus on specific issues such as climate change or environmental health policy. They may work under other job titles such as research associate, advisor, program manager, or regulatory analyst. Environmental policy analysts provide research and analytical services for policy briefs related to energy sources, climate change, environmental justice, environmental health, and related issues. For example, they gather, research, review, and analyze existing environmental policies, practices, procedures, and laws to determine their environmental and economic impacts. They also analyze and summarize new scientific research for legislators and regulatory agencies, and conduct life-cycle cost analyses of processes, energy sources, and technologies. After thorough analyses of relevant factors, they write reports, policy briefs, and white papers detailing their findings to inform government or environmental groups on issues and strategies such as energy storage or carbon sequestration. They may also present recommendations to government agencies or environmental groups through public relations efforts, awareness campaigns, or meetings. Where Does an Environmental Policy Analyst Work? Many environmental policy analysts work for environment and health organizations at all levels of government, from federal agencies to state, county, and city departments. Others provide services as government contractors or consultants. Many are employed by environmental nonprofit organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund and World Resources Institute. Some work for energy and utility providers. They frequently work together with scientists, engineers, regulators, legislators, citizens, businesses, and nonprofit organizations to craft recommendations and promote initiatives. Most work full time in offices during standard working hours, though overtime may sometimes be required. Jobs in this field are available worldwide, but unsurprisingly, many U.S. jobs with government agencies, think tanks, associations, and policy centers are located in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. What Is the Average Environmental Policy Analyst Salary? While the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) doesn't report on environmental policy analysts, it reported the average annual salary for climate change analysts as $65,090 in 2013.
