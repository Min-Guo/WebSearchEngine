To learn more about education options and career paths in these fields, read on. Inside Microbiology and Immunology Microbiologists examine how microscopic organisms develop and how they interact with other organisms. Immunology is concerned with how microbiological factors trigger or fail to trigger a response in the human immune system. Both fields offer good job prospects for graduates, including in cancer and virology research, histology, toxicology, the food industry and environmental science. Education Information Most programs that focus specifically on microbiology and/or immunology are offered at the master's and doctoral levels, though there are some undergraduate degree programs in biology with concentrations in microbiology and immunology. All of these educational programs are designed to provide knowledge and skills required for laboratory and research positions, with some designed as complements to medical or public health training. Most independent researchers in microbiology and immunology hold a doctoral degree; entry-level positions are available with a bachelor's degree, though. Degree Options Most programs that cover immunology and biology are offered to graduate students. However, there are also bachelor's degree and pre-professional programs. Microbiology Graduate Programs Immunology Degrees and Certificates Microbiologist Education Requirements Clinical Microbiology Programs Laboratory Technician Programs Biology Degrees Distance Learning Options There are a few online degree programs focused on microbiology. The following articles explain more about these alternatives.
