Enjoy Free Classic Books  Site Map > Home Page Nav Bar: what's this?  Search for a book The life story of Neal Dempsey 15 June 1934 - 13 August 2005 "The easy readability program - ingenious idea well implemented!!" Dolly Maker Personalized Classics "This is a great site to read the classics, the best I've seen so far." Victoria Vi "Totally brilliant - and a life-saver in what might have been a very boring job for me at a rather quiet front desk." Paul Norton Great Expectations "I was looking for a place I could read classic books on the web when I stumbled into your site. I don't know how to thank you enough for the service you give to people like me. Thank you so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" Juan Paredes "I like the big text. It's less straining on the eyes (dare I say it?) than reading the actual book." Paul Stanek "This is great! I have not seen an easier way to read books online and I read many." David Perdue The Charles Dickens Page "I like your site a lot and would like to recommend it when people are looking for books on line." Myretta Robens The Republic Of Pemberley "Classic Bookshelf has developed a unique method of displaying a book on the internet, which is the closest thing yet to the true experience of reading a book." NETWeek Editor's Choice "Visitors reading e-texts at this site do not have to settle for a sometimes difficult-to-read default display." Internet Scout Project NEW BOOKS FROM OLD Electrifying Classics Books have changed. Not the words but how books are shared. This simple reading program is going to help you make the most of electronic format classic books. You can share them through your website too. Many people are saying, "Electronic reading is hard." And they're mostly right. But using this Java applet these books almost read themselves. You doubt it - well try it right now. Open Charles Dickens' Christmas Carol now. Experiment with the option controls. See for yourself how you could enjoy these books for hours. Right For You Everyone is different. You have your favorite colors, unique eyesight, room lighting and so on. Old fashioned books, printed on paper, can't adapt to you personally. But this Java eBook reading program does. That's its beauty. We're Not Talking Books Choose your best font with a mouse click. The book redraws itself at once using the new font. Change the print height for greatest comfort. The book redraws again. Now change the colors. Black and white are excellent in bright sunlight. Blues and greens might be better in the evening. Do you like parallel margins? Justify or don't, it's up to you. Each time you change an option or turn a page the book redraws itself. It's the next best thing to a talking book. Come Back For More Choose longer stories and use the free bookmarking feature. Close a book, type your email address and get a free bookmark. You can then reopen your book at the same page and with the same font/color/layout settings. Your privacy is important. We will not pass on your email address and we will only use it to send you bookmarks. Spread The Words Do you have a website or a home page? You can increase your traffic by hosting classic books.
