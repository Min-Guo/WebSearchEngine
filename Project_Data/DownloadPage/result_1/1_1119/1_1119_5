What they had was a vision of making marketers' lives easier, so they started a company called "Untitled Startup" with the goal of turning that vision into a reality. Damon had been working on a side project tracking Twitter volume and, after countless nights of working over beers at Murphy's Pub, the duo began to recognize a growing need for easily organized social media data. Aviel and Damon joined forces with CEO Adam Schoenfeld and together the three co-founders developed the idea of social analytics as a marketing essential, turning Untitled Startup into Simply Measured. Today, Simply Measured is the most powerful social analytics solution in the world, giving marketers insight from a dozen social networks, and helping them make a greater impact on their overall business goals. Aviel and Damon still work over beers, but now they do it surrounded by 150 data-loving geeks who are just as excited and passionate about solving problems as they are. Now, Simply Measured occupies a gorgeous, waterfront office space in downtown Seattle, but the focus is still on helping marketers do their best work, simply. We Love It Here. You Will, Too.
