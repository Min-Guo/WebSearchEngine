Welcome! My name is Melissa, a happy and healthy gamer geek living in California. Here you'll find a great source of geekery and video game knowledge combined with the skills for happy and healthy everyday living.         Home About Contact Ask Archive GAMES I'M PLAYING [ ALL THE GAMES ] My Games Favorite Developers Video Game Guides Video Game Reviews Alright my dear hearts. As I am inundated with extra games from my penchant for Humble Bundles, I have decided to give one (or more) away each month for the rest of the year, and perhaps beyond. For the month of March, I am giving away a Steam code for Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition. What to do, between March 1st and March 15th. ♥ Reblog this! Must be following me (geekatheartily). Must have a Steam account. On March 16th, 2016 I will announce the winner of Tomb Raider: Game of the Year Edition. To redeem your prize, you must be willing to supply your name and email to the Humble Bundle website (They will only send you emails if you want them). Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor!
