You can view and print our glossary () which provides definitions to help you understand retirement terms used throughout this website. You may also want to visit the MyFRS website, which is a cooperative website of the Department of Management Services and the Florida State Board of Administration. It is part of the MyFRS Financial Guidance Program and offers online planning models and choice tools to help employees eligible for membership in the FRS to choose between the FRS Pension Plan and the FRS Investment Plan. The website also provides access to resources available under both plans. Member Annual Statements (MAS) Beginning January 2016, members will receive their MAS in the month you were born. The Division of Retirement will email you when your 2016 MAS is available. You can access your historical MAS from your FRS Online account. Click to access your MAS The MAS is only available to active pension plan participants and active hybrid plan participants.   Retirement Plan Risk All retirement plans, including the FRS Pension Plan, have risk. When the funding of the FRS Pension Plan is less than 100%, benefits or contribution levels may be affected. The FRS Pension Plan funding valuation takes place annually and was 86.5 percent funded, as of July 1, 2015. You can view the chart that compares the plan's actuarial liabilities to the plan's actuarial assets for the past five years. The annual benefits payments to FRS retirees and beneficiaries are part of the overall plan liabilities. Selecting a retirement plan is an important decision. Before making a plan decision, examine all available options. The FRS also offers an investment plan which gives you the ability to control your retirement funds. Before making any retirement plan decision we strongly encourage all employees to take advantage, at no cost or obligation, of the Advisory Services provided by EY at 866-446-9377.
