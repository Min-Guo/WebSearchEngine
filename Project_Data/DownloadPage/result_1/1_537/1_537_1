Du Bois > The Souls of Black Folk Herein lie buried many things which if read with patience may show the strange meaning of being black here in the dawning of the Twentieth Century. This meaning is not without interest to you, Gentle Reader; for the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-line. W.E.B. Du Bois The Souls of Black Folk   W.E.B. Du Bois   W.E.B. Du Bois said, on the launch of his groundbreaking 1903 treatise The Souls of Black Folk, for the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color-linea prescient statement. Setting out to show to the reader the strange meaning of being black here in the dawning of the Twentieth Century, Du Bois explains the meaning of the emancipation, and its effect, and his views on the role of the leaders of his race.   Search:       CONTENTS Bibliographic Record TO Burghardt and Yolande THE LOST AND THE FOUND   CHICAGO: A.C.
