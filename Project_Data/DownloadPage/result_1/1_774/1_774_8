Jack SamuelG+ General Help  -  2016-04-14   I received a notification on Google+ to both of my Google+ Communities (which I own) that reads: "Stronger post filtering has been turned on. To review visit edit community." This is something that I'm assuming is a new feature because I've never seen it before. The problem is that when I go to the Google+ "edit community" section I don't see any option for post filtering. Am I missing something? Or is this a new feature that's coming soon?﻿Read moreShow less 3 1 4 comments John Skeats + 1 2 1   Hi +Jack Samuel. You can read more about stronger filtering in the following post.

Rudy MartinG+ Questions - Desktop  -  2016-04-14   #Tombstone Admin profile linked to G+ Private community# Hi, wonder if anyone can help me in my slight dilemma... We have a G+ Private community, which was created (Admin) by a past employee, whom has since left and the original google account deleted months ago. :( What options do I have to regain ownership of the Private community, which is still actively used within our Dept? I've tried the following, without any joy:  - re-creating the original google profile, in hope to unlock the tombstone profile linked to the google plus community.   Is there a way to force a moderator to take ownership of the community? How do I see which account is actually the current admin profile of the community, just to make sure I have the correct old user profile? ATM, it shows no admin.  Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks﻿Read moreShow less 1 4 comments Rudy Martin + 0 1 0   +John Elstone , thanks. I guess it's a re-create then.

Profiles are designed to represent people. Business pages are obviously designed to represent people. They have a number of features that are designed to support businesses more effectively that profiles can. You can create a page in Google My Business (google.com/mybusiness).
