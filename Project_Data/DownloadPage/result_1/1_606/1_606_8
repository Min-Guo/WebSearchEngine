A sponsorship of just $140 covers the academy fees for a Bridge pupil for their entire academic year, as well as a new school uniform!  This includes nearly 50 hours of instruction a week for 11 months, textbooks for every subject, fun reading books, practical learning tools, homework books, co-curriculars, and more.
