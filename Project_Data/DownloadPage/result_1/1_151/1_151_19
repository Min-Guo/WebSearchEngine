To submit your session, visit http://www.aslo.org/forms/stjohns2008.html Discover St. Johns! Come discover one of the oldest cities in North America! - cradled in a harbor carved from granite, surrounded by hills running down to the ocean, quaint side streets of a thousand colors, friendly faces waiting to greet you and where old and new, city and nature, live as neighbors. ASLO is proud to visit this historic city for the 2008 Summer Meeting. This meeting is designed to be both environmentally and family friendly! It is also very suitable for European attendees-just five hours flight from London. The theme of the meeting reflects the history, geographical location and geomorphology of our host town. This meeting is about interactions; between scientists of course, and also between disciplines and approaches, between ecosystems and environments - freshwater and marine. Standing at the easternmost edge of North America, oceans lakes and rivers define the landscape and shape the people and their interactions with the world. Water and fish brought the first Newfoundlanders here and still define their identity. Our visit to St. John's will be a great opportunity to explore linkages between limnology, oceanography and fisheries. We will also highlight cold-water ecosystems. What better place than Newfoundland at the time of year when icebergs dot the coast? Finally, we cannot come to Newfoundland without thinking about our past and revisiting our roots. Ancestors and history are alive in the collective memory here, and we will take time to reflect on the progress and directions of our discipline in the 25 years since ASLO last met in St. John's. Plenary lectures will be held Monday through Friday. Poster and oral sessions will be held throughout the meeting. As for the edge(s), you'll see when you get here. (For a sneak preview, look at the web cam mounted at the Ocean Sciences Centre of Memorial University, just outside St. John's at http://www.osc.mun.ca/seals/oldbaycam.html.) Let's take risks, let's explore interactions, let's go to the edge of our science, and let's make this a great meeting! 2008 ASLO Summer Meeting Co-Chairs, M.
