Old Gym Restoration Under Way! As you may be aware, work on the historic �Old Gym� located at Trenton Elementary School has started!� The building was built in 1939-1940, and was moved from the Trenton High School campus in 2004.� Now, through grant dollars, we are starting work on restoring the building.� In addition to the restoration of the building itself, there are plans to pave a path to the historic gym using commemorative bricks purchased by the community and engraved with names. Many community members have already supported this project by purchasing commemorative bricks to be used in the walkway to the gym.� We are happy to announce that you have not missed out on the opportunity to be included in this historic project! At this time, we are once again opening up the sale of these commemorative bricks.� We understand the significance and historical value of this long-awaited restoration, so we want to be sure that everyone has the opportunity to be included.� If you would like to purchase a brick, the cost is $100 and the order form is available HERE.� To order, simply fill out the order form, make your check payable to TES, and submit to the front office or committee member Ms. Jo Smith.� Your brick can include up to three lines with 16 characters per line (including spaces).� Your brick can be engraved with your business name or family name, can be dedicated to a loved one, can be purchased in honor of a cancer survivor, or can simply be engraved with your name as a supporter of this project.� There are many options, but just be sure not to miss out.�� � If you have already purchased a brick, but would like to update your message or order additional bricks, please complete the form and return to Ms. Jo Smith at 4550 SW CR 232 / Bell, Florida� 32619.� For questions regarding brick sales, Ms. Smith can be reached at (352) 226-0754.� Thank you for your continued support of this historical project!� � � Survey for Parents of ESE Students We need your help to make Florida's 2015-16 ESE Parent Survey a success!
