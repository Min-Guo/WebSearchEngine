Did You Know? See the press release. Spring is officially here and that means spring cleaning and flower planting are on the "To Do" list. If you are cleaning out the garage or the clutter around your house, make the effort to recycle the electronics, fluorescent lights, old pesticides and cleaners, and anything else with toxic components to keep those toxins out of the environment. Use the "Where Do I Recycle" link on this page to find recycling options near you for all these materials and more. Then go plant something! Who can use the program? Households, small businesses, schools & school districts, small governments, special purpose districts, and charities can recycle electronic products free of charge in this program. More information. Where can I recycle? Visit 1800recycle.wa.gov or call 1-800-RECYCLE to find electronic product recycling services in your area. What can I recycle for free through E-Cycle Washington?

The majority of the electronics are disassembled for recycling here in Washington. Some electronics go out-of-state for processing and some materials are exported for recycling at approved facilities. However, obsolete electronics are not exported to third-world countries. Metals, plastics and glass are separated and sold as commodities to be reused as raw materials in the manufacturing of new products. On average only 2% of the total volume goes to a landfill - mostly particle board from cabinet TVs. Toxic materials such as batteries, leaded glass, circuit boards and fluorescent tubes must be managed properly by approved recyclers. Ecology also requires recyclers to meet standards designed to protect worker safety and health as well as the environment. What if my electronic equipment still works? Many groups and businesses focus on making used electronics available for reuse. More information on donating your electronics for reuse. WHERE DO I RECYCLE?
