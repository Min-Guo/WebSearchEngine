Environmental health is the branch of public health that is concerned with all aspects of the natural and built environment that may affect human health. Other terms that refer to the discipline of environmental health include environmental public health and environmental health and protection. Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviors. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. Environmental Health is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. These goals are accomplished by conducting surveillance, issuing regulatory permits when applicable and performing inspections. We also investigate complaints concerning nuisances injurious to public health and respond in the event of a natural or man-made disaster. Please select a program topic form the list for specific information on our programs. Our Environmental Specialists are available Monday-Friday for in office consultations from 8:00 a.m.- 9:00 a.m. Connect with DOH #HealthiestWeightFL 1 out of 3 kids are now considered overweight or obese. 65% of adults in Florida are at an unhealthy weight.
