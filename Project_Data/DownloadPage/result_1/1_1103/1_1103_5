This video takes you inside today's high-tech electronics recycling operations. Find an electronics collection site near you. Subscribe to Electronics Recycling email updates. Electronics are one of the fastest growing parts of the waste stream, with millions of devices discarded each year in the United States. Computers, TVs, cell phones and other electronics contain valuable materials that can be recovered through responsible recycling. Electronics also contain potentially hazardous materials, such as lead and mercury, that can pose a risk to human health and the environment if not properly managed. Wisconsin’s electronics recycling law keeps many devices out of landfills and incinerators and creates recycling opportunities for state residents. Electronics recycling is a growing industry in the state, creating jobs and preserving valuable resources.
