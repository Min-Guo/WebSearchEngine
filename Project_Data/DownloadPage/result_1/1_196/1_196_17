What will be my level or length of volunteer commitment to the West Central Florida MRC? What types of volunteers are you looking for? The West Central Florida Medical Reserve Corps is looking for a variety of individuals. The Medical Reserve Corps needs practicing or retired Florida-licensed health care professionals such as physicians, nurses, pharmacists, pharmacy techs, respiratory therapists, social workers, mental health counselors, health educators, epidemiologists, paramedics/EMTs and veterinarians, to name a few. Equally important the MRC also needs non-medical volunteers for key support roles as in logistics, administration, greeters, educators, communications, safety, security, clinic flow direction, registration, interpreters, pet care and chaplain services. How many people will be needed? This will depend on the size and scope of the emergency and the needs of the community. If, for example, the entire population of West Central Florida should need to be vaccinated, hundreds of individuals would be needed to staff vaccine dispensing points. The West Central Florida Medical Reserve Corps is striving to recruit as many qualified people as possible so that if any kind of emergency occurs the volunteers would be registered, credentialed, trained and ready to be called into service as needed. What kinds of tasks will I be assigned? The West Central Florida Medical Reserve Corps makes every effort to match volunteers’ skills and interests with existing needs. After your membership application is accepted, you will be assigned to or trained for an appropriate role based on your qualifications and interests. You will never be asked to perform a function which exceeds your scope of knowledge, skills, abilities or comfort level! What about liability for MRC volunteers? As part of completing the application and credentialing process, you will complete the State of Florida’s Volunteer 110 application. The Volunteer 110 provides MRC volunteer members with sovereign immunity (liability) and Workers Compensation protection while working with the MRC. More information is provided in MRC member packets, or upon request. Am I required to report for duty at the time of an emergency even if my employer needs me or if I have family commitments? As an MRC volunteer, you should expect to be called to help in an emergency. You should be as prepared as possible, and make plans for your family, too, so that you are available to help. However, work and family commitments are understood. We hope you will plan ahead and be prepared to assist your community with the MRC should an emergency occur. Ultimately, it will be your choice! Should you need to turn down a mission request, it will NOT impact your status with the MRC. You will called again the next time we activate. What kind of training will I get for dealing with medical emergencies? The Medical Reserve Corps has three (3) required classes to become an MRC member. Additional training will be provided and strongly encouraged. Some training will also provide Continuing Education Units. The required courses are FEMA IS-100 Incident Command System, FEMA IS-700 Introduction to the National Incident Management System (NIMS), and the Medical Reserve Corps Core Competencies course, offered by NOVA Southeastern University. All required classes are FREE and provided online! Go to the “How to Apply” link to the left of this page for links to these courses. How will I be contacted in an emergency? When you register with Medical Reserve Corps, you will provide your contact information — e-mail, home address, phone numbers, and other appropriate information in the State Emergency Responders and Volunteers of Florida (SERVFL), online database. This database is kept current and will be used to communicate with all West Central Florida Medical Reserve Corps members regarding activations, deployments, trainings, and other important information. It is very important that you keep your contact information up to date. Does acceptance for membership in West Central Florida MRC legally obligate me to volunteer in an emergency? No. Your service with the MRCs voluntary and you are not legally obligated to assist in an emergency or any other situation. At the time an emergency occurs, you may be alerted or called and asked to volunteer. The decision you make at that time is up to you. Are there any provisions for compensating me for time lost from work or other expenses? West Central Florida MRC members are covered under the Florida 110 volunteer program. The volunteer 110 program provide sovereign immunity liability and Workers Compensation coverage while you working as an MRC member. See the volunteer 110 information provided in your member packet for details. At this time, no provisions exist for compensating volunteers for time lost from work, mileage, meal costs, etc. In the event of an emergency, such provisions may be available, but they are not defined at this time. Will I be asked to volunteer for an emergency event outside of West Central Florida? The West Central Florida MRC is intended to be a local response unit. However, the state of Florida and/or National Medical Reserve Corps may request resources. When you register with MRC, you will be asked if you are interested in deploying around the state and/or nationally. Your service during such incidents is entirely voluntary. What will be my level or length of volunteer commitment to the West Central Florida MRC? There is no specific required number of volunteer hours or length of service. We expect your participation to be determined by your own availability and interest, but hope that you will serve for at least a year.
